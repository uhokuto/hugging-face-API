"The tuna was amazing, but everything else was disappointing.","Located just near Omotesando Station, I visited Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera after hearing a lot of buzz on social media.On a weekday around 1 PM, there were about 8 groups ahead of me, and I waited around 20 minutes to be seated. It seemed like around 80% of the customers were foreign tourists. The atmosphere felt more geared towards inbound visitors rather than sushi enthusiasts.You order from a panel, and the staff places the sushi on the non-moving conveyor belt. The interior has a sophisticated vibe, but the staff lacked energy and a sense of hospitality.I initially ordered yellowtail, salmon, sweet shrimp, and geoduck, but both the salmon and yellowtail were average and didnÅft impress me. The shrimp and shellfish had a strong fishy smell, which was quite disappointing. IÅfve never encountered such a fishy taste even at budget conveyor sushi chains.Undeterred, I tried the medium fatty tuna and tuna gunkan (sushi rolls), and the tuna was incredibly delicious. ItÅfs their specialty, and I was relieved to find it lived up to its reputation. The medium fatty tuna was large and melt-in-your-mouth, providing a satisfying experience.I hesitated to order more, but fearing another disappointing dish, I decided to leave. For better cost performance and taste, IÅfd recommend visiting other popular conveyor sushi spots instead of this one, aside from the tuna."
"A renowned spot in Ginza, but the rice and vinegared flavor could use some improvement.","To be upfront, I don't have much experience with high-end sushi, so I'm not sure if my evaluation is fair. However, personally, I feel it doesn't quite live up to the other reviews.If I wanted standing sushi (not that this place is one), I would go elsewhere.It's located down an alley in Omotesando. You can wait in line using E park, but on a Thursday after 6 PM, it wasn't even necessary.That's impressive enough. There were many inbound tourists, but also a few Japanese customers.The ceiling sparkles, giving a luxurious impression. It definitely has a photogenic vibe.I started off with a beer.Now, the menu is on a tablet. There are many tempting options, and while the prices are reasonable, they are still on the higher side.I ordered a few items at random.Overall impressions:- The fish was decent, but nothing stood out, and it didn't fully bring out the quality of the ingredients.- The rice left no impression. If I recall correctly, it was a bit hard. It was red vinegar, but I can't remember any distinct flavorswas it sour or sweet?- For high-end sushi, I expect a harmony between the fish and rice, but this felt more like a mid-range conveyor belt sushi level.Well, if this is the quality for the price, I think IÅfm good with that.The freshly prepared sea bream and the swordfish were quite tasty, though.I hope they can attract more inbound demand.Thank you for the meal!"
A restaurant catering to foreign travelers,"Kaiten Sushi Onodera near Omotesando Station.I made a reservation online and was told to expect a one-hour wait, but I received a notification that my table was ready just 15 minutes later. Since I was far away, I arrived 15 minutes after the notification, only to find that I had to check in again and ended up waiting an additional 30 minutes.The system was confusing, and perhaps due to the busy atmosphere, the staff at the reception seemed a bit rude.All orders are placed via iPad, with each piece of sushi costing around JPY 500.The sushi was incredibly delicious! The raw sakura shrimp gunkan and toro-taku were especially tasty!While the staff poured Japanese sake with cheerful shouts, which might be fun for foreign travelers, personally, I felt that it wasn't necessary to be here."
The Best Kaiten Sushi,"This is my second visit!The sushi is incredibly fresh, with thick cuts that are absolutely delicious!My top recommendation is the comparison tasting of yellowtail. The rich fat content really enhances the flavor.The fish broth is also packed with meat, making it a must-try dish.The atmosphere and the service from the staff are both excellent, making me want to come back again and again! I will definitely return."
You might not be able to get in right away when the restaurant opens.,"ÅyNotes, PointsÅzThere is a ticket machine at the entrance.You can get a point card by registering as a friend on LINE.Ordering is done via a tablet, and the sushi is not on a conveyor belt.ÅyMotivationÅzI decided to revisit because I had a good impression from my last visit.ÅyOrder, Visit Date SituationÅzDined in with three family members.Arrived at the entrance around 9:40 AM on a holiday Monday.I took a ticket and waited with four other groups.On this day, there were 23 groups waiting around 10:27 AM.I parked my car in a nearby street parking (JPY 300 for 60 minutes) and went to wait at the entrance around the opening time of 10:27 AM.The restaurant opened around 10:32 AM.I was guided inside according to my ticket number and seated.I placed my order through the tablet and settled the bill at the end.Payment was made using a credit card at the register near the entrance when leaving.ÅyImpressions, etc.ÅzI ordered more sushi than what is shown in the photos, and I did not drink any alcohol.The total bill for three family members was around JPY 25,000.The prices are on the higher side, but the sushi was quite delicious.The atmosphere felt somewhat like a restaurant aimed at tourists."
Inbound-Friendly Kaiten Sushi in Omotesando,"Dinner during Golden Week.At the casual branch of Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, you can order sushi according to your appetite, making it easy to enjoy a light meal.The restaurant is a dazzling large establishment in Omotesando. You can easily spot it by the crowd of customers waiting around the entrance. About 80% of those waiting were inbound foreign visitors.We made a web reservation and arrived earlier than the estimated time of 4 hours. The system is quite unreliable, as it notifies you of your turn while youÅfre still on the train, which makes the estimated time feel low-precision. However, since we had a reservation, we checked in and were called shortly after. In the end, making a reservation is definitely recommended.Orders are placed individually on tablets. According to my daughterÅfs research, the recommended item is the Hon Maguro from Yamako, with prices like JPY 730 for Chutoro (medium fatty tuna) and JPY 990 for Otoro (fatty tuna). I wondered if these were tourist prices, but we went ahead and ordered.The highlights included Otoro, Chutoro, Nakaochi Gunkan, Aosa Miso Soup, and Aburi Salmon, with my daughter particularly enjoying the Hokkaido live octopus.The Aburi Salmon had just the right amount of fat and saltiness, which I liked. The Aosa Miso Soup was delicious with a rich shellfish broth. My daughter loved the Hokkaido live octopus so much that we ordered three plates of it. However, the Murasaki Uni (purple sea urchin) was honestly a bit disappointing, as it lacked the expected flavor of uni.The prices are on the higher side! I believe you can find sushi of the same quality for a bit cheaper at places like Tsukiji. But for foreign visitors, the entertainment value might make it worth recommending."
Enjoy famous sushi in a casual setting,"I finally got to visit Onodera, a place I had wanted to try for a long time! It definitely had an atmosphere geared towards inbound tourists, with many visitors from abroad. Perhaps because my expectations were so high, I felt the cost-performance ratio was lacking. The toro and otoro made with Yamako's tuna were incredible, but I found them difficult to chew. The price per piece seemed to range from JPY 400 to JPY 1000. For tourists, I think itÅfs a great option!  If you want to eat a lot, I estimate it would cost around JPY 10,000 per person."
The Most Famous Tuna Kaiten Sushi Restaurant: Ginza Onodera,"I've been wanting to visit this sushi restaurant for a long time. It's a kaiten sushi place from the Onodera group, famous for winning the top tuna at auctions every year.I had lunch at their main branch in Ginza before, and it was incredibly delicious, so my expectations were high even for a kaiten sushi restaurant.They open at 10:30 AM, and I arrived at 11:00 AM. After about a 10-minute wait, I was seated! Although itÅfs called kaiten sushi, the sushi doesnÅft actually rotate. You order via a touch panel and receive your sushi directly from the staff.I focused on tuna, ordering seared chutoro, chutoro, tekka maki, and akami. Even considering my tuna bias, everything was incredibly tasty! Surprisingly, the akami was quite fatty and I loved it! Of course, the chutoro was even more melt-in-your-mouth delicious.I also enjoyed my favorite engawa and bonito. The bonito was in season and incredibly fresh!I had plans for a caf as my second stop, so I finished with about 60% fullness.At around JPY 4500 for this amount, it felt a bit pricey, but the taste is guaranteed. I recommend it for those who want to enjoy delicious sushi without a high barrier to entry, especially if you love tunait's definitely worth a visit!"
Melt-in-your-mouth Nakaochi Gunkan,"The Yamakou tuna is truly exceptional.This is my second visit.Recommended dishes: Nakaochi GunkanI ordered this for the first time, and it was a huge hit! It has the richness of chutoro, melting in your mouth with incredible flavor. I could eat as many as I want. Hand-rolled SushiYou can really taste the flavor of the seaweed, and thereÅfs tuna all the way to the endsuch a luxurious treat. EngawaThick and with a delightful crunch! The richness is surprising for the price, and the quality is outstanding.The rice is made with red vinegar, but itÅfs not overpowering and enhances the flavor of the toppings. Additionally, the option to choose less rice is a nice touch! ItÅfs a considerate service for women and those with smaller appetites.Important note for visitors:You can register for a waitlist through EPARK. They stopped accepting registrations around 19:40, so I recommend arriving early if you plan to visit!The restaurant was very lively with many foreign tourists. It felt like over 90% of the customers were from abroad, and the prices seem to cater to international visitors."

Reconfirming that sushi is all about the skill of the chef,"95% of the customers are foreigners. The sushi is within the expected range for a high-end kaiten sushi restaurant, but the cost-performance is not great. If you can overlook that, the menu is diverse and enjoyable. The location is also good, so it might be worth knowing about.If you consider it separate from Sushi Onodera in Ginza, it could be acceptable? The sea urchin and eel were delicious."
Delicious Tuna at Yamako! @Omotesando," This is the Kaiten Sushi style of the renowned sushi restaurant, Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, located in Omotesando. I recommend waiting in line through EPARK before heading to the restaurant. Speaking of Onodera, the tuna sourced from Yamako, a famous tuna wholesaler, was incredibly delicious. I enjoyed a variety of cuts including lean, marinated, chu-toro, o-toro, cheek meat, toro-taku, and tekka maki, and they were all exquisite. The dishes besides tuna are also delightful. While it is pricier compared to regular kaiten sushi, considering it as a high-end sushi restaurant, the value for money is excellent."
The Pinnacle of Kaiten Sushi,"I finally visited the restaurant I've wanted to go to for so long, ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera.""Located in Tokyo's Ginza, ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" has 22 branches across three countries, aiming to spread refined Japanese culture worldwide through food.

Almost like being abroad,"I made a reservation through EPARK and had to wait 80 minutes for 19 groups.In reality, the wait was about 35-40 minutes.While I was getting ready to head home from work, I received a call, so I hurried to Omotesando.I tried several dishes, mainly focusing on the lean cuts from Yamakou.After 8 PM, about 10-20% of the items were sold out, so I had to go light as my favorites were unavailable.Most of the customers waiting for reservations were foreigners, making up over 90% of the crowd.This place is basically a foreign spot!I guess it's an inbound restaurant."
Top-Ranked Kaiten Sushi in Tokyo,"I visited Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, ranked as one of the top conveyor belt sushi spots in Tokyo! Compared to other conveyor belt sushi restaurants, the variety was impressive and the taste was more than satisfying. (ÅLÅ§ÅM)Ém The only downside is that, being in Omotesando, the prices are a bit on the higher side. However, if you're looking to enjoy conveyor belt sushi in Omotesando, I believe there's no better place than this!"
Delicious options beyond just tuna!,"I regularly visit Yamako to enjoy their tuna. This time, I had a variety of tuna (lean, medium fatty, fatty, and hand rolls with fatty tuna), but I was disappointed that they didn't have the marinated tuna and medium fatty tuna hand rolls available. However, the sweet shrimp, shako (mantis shrimp), and kohada (gizzard shad) were all incredibly delicious. In particular, the sakura buri (cherry salmon, in season?) was exceptionally good this time. As usual, I started with some appetizers and beer, but the limited spring sake was delightful. It was a great meal!"
In Search of Yamako's Tuna,"At this new location of Onodera, there were many foreign guests. We were particularly excited to try the maguro from Yamako. We had both the fatty tuna and the lean tuna, which were thick and had a wonderful texture. Additionally, the shrimp and salmon were all delicious."

Affordable Dining at Onodera,"I've been wanting to go for a long time, so this was a dream come true. Each piece is around JPY 500. I feel that Hokkaido-style conveyor belt sushi offers better value, but I believe the Onodera brand holds its own value. The anago (sea eel) and tuna were delicious. I also loved the thick engawa (flounder fin). The use of red vinegar was a nice touch as well. The staff was energetic and seemed to be having a great time. I want to try the Trymon next!"
Delicious Sushi,"I waited 68 minutes for lunch on a weekday.I made a reservation through the touch panel and while shopping nearby, my turn came around quickly.Most of the customers were foreigners.The sushi was delicious, with thick cuts that matched the reasonable prices.However, I prefer to enjoy tasty sushi in a quiet setting.Given the atmosphere here, I feel like I could go to other chain restaurants instead.But if you want to enjoy quick and delicious sushi in a lively environment, this place is great!However, the miso soup was incredibly bland... The portions were very generous, and I was quite satisfied.It was a great meal!"

"A bit pricey, but delicious","The medium fatty tuna at Yamakou was delicious and worth the higher price! However, I regretted ordering the ramen, which was rather mediocre compared to the seafood miso soup I should have chosen instead. I ordered it because it was cold, but I wouldn't order it again. After eating the ramen, I felt quite satisfied, but then the fresh-cut yellowtail and the freshly made dashimaki tamago (Japanese omelet) came out, and I couldn't resist ordering them, haha. Without those, my bill would have been just over JPY 3000. But both dishes were so good that I was glad I ordered them. My total was JPY 4760 for 10 pieces of sushi plus a mini ramen, tax included! The noise level in the restaurant felt very much geared towards tourists, so it might not be the best place for those looking to enjoy sushi in a calm atmosphere. Even as someone who enjoys lively kaiten sushi, I found it a bit overwhelming. There were semi-private seating options available, but they were close to the restrooms, which made me hesitate about that. I would love to visit a more tranquil Onodera next time."
Luxury Kaiten Sushi Experience (*ÅL™`*),"Honestly, if I had to choose between this place and Sushi Å¸, it would be a tough decision! The quality of the fish here is superior.However, the customers are ordering non-stop without even looking at the menu. The tables are packed.Spending over JPY 10,000 in under an hour while drinking... It's a dilemma, isn't it?If you want to enjoy delicious food quickly, this is the place!But if you're looking to have a nice conversation with your meal, this might not be the right spot.The sushi rice is made with red vinegar, but the grains stick together.The toppings are great and thick, but due to the fast pace, they come out cold.The cod milt miso soup had a generous amount, which was a pleasant surprise, but there was too much ginger to mask the smell, so it mostly tasted like ginger!"

Great quality at this price. Delicious!,"I had some otoro at the affordable branch of the upscale sushi restaurant ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" for lunch, and it melted in my mouth instantly! I think it's a great deal at JPY 950 per piece for such quality. It's a popular spot, so the wait can be up to 200 minutes! It's been a while since I've had such delicious sushi! So for dinner, I had a simple bowl of plain soba noodles. #Sushi#Otoro#KaitenSushiGinzaOnoderaMainStore"
This is good in its own way.,"It seems to be a well-established business. The customer turnout is impressive and quite enviable.The sushi toppings are moderately thin and vary in quality, but overall, they are quite tasty.However, there seems to be a lack of awareness regarding the people and things around them. I got a strange impression that itÅfs neither a luxurious high-end restaurant nor a systematic, value-oriented chain.While I believe the quality is close to that of a high-end restaurant, it would have been nice to feel a delicate touch that distinguishes it from a chain restaurant in a positive way."
Incredibly delicious Chutoro,"This was my first visit. Since it was a weekday, I didnÅft have to wait long, and I arrived just in time after checking in online while on the train. The location is convenient, just a short walk from the station. The medium fatty tuna and steamed eel were absolutely delicious. I prefer the medium fatty tuna over the fatty tuna. Overall, the portions were generous and tasty. We spent JPY 20,000 for two, which seems reasonable, but compared to other places like Manten Sushi, it felt a bit pricey."

Casual Dining at Yamako,"While high-end restaurants offering omakase courses are undeniably delicious, there are times when you simply want to select what you want to eat freely.I had a strong craving for sardines and decided to revisit this place based on my previous positive experience. I was worried about the crowd due to the inbound tourism, but surprisingly, I arrived around 11:40 on a weekday and had almost no waiting time. What a relief! ÅôThis restaurant, Onodera, is well-known since it's featured during the first auction at Toyosu.I appreciate that they serve real bluefin tuna from Yamako at this conveyor sushi restaurant. The conveyor belt is still at a standstill, as usual. Of course, I ordered the medium fatty tuna, and in addition to the regular sardines, there was a new itemgrilled sardines.I noticed slight acidity from the vinegar-marinated raw sardines, so I preferred the grilled version. It was topped with fried green onions. The winter sardines were rich in fat and delicious.On that day, there were also grilled swordfish and boiled snow crab available. The marinated ikura (salmon roe) was delightful.I was disappointed to learn that the boiled sweet shrimp was sold out (ÅGÅG)During my last visit in early summer, I realized that fish taste better in winter and appreciated that I could order as much medium fatty tuna as I wanted today. Last time, there were fewer types of ingredients available."
Overall high quality,"There was a mix-up with my order, but overall the food is delicious.It's not the typical quality you'd expect from kaiten sushi.The chu-toro (medium fatty tuna) is especially outstanding. The akami (red meat) had a slight fishy smell, though...The ikura (salmon roe) paired perfectly with the soy sauce."

Premium Kaiten Sushi,"I had been curious about this restaurant. I made a reservation and was able to enter without waiting since it was my turn when I arrived.Although itÅfs called a kaiten (conveyor belt) sushi restaurant, they no longer use the conveyor belt, so itÅfs not really kaiten sushi anymore.The interior is quite spacious, with semi-private booths and table seating available.There were many international customers.The prices are high, but the taste is absolutely delicious. I was waiting for soy sauce to be served in a small dish, but the chef applied it directly on the sushi before serving, which was amusing.The cost-performance ratio isnÅft great, so I feel like itÅfs a place IÅfd like to visit just once."
"High expectations may have been the issue; the sushi was delicious, but satisfaction was another story? ~ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera (Omotesando)","I visited the Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, a high-end sushi restaurant that usually has a high threshold for entry, located in Omotesando. I went during the weekend lunch hour, and based on comments from other diners on sites like Tabelog, it seems to get crowded at all times. The restaurant opens at 10:30 AM and does not accept reservations, so I arrived just after 10:00 AM, checked in on the tablet at the entrance, and waited for opening time. I thought I would be able to enter on time as the third group, but when I got there, there was a crowd at the entrance. Ultimately, they did not open on time, and I had to wait about 20 minutes outside to get in. It felt like a long wait in the freezing cold, almost like it was going to snow.Inside, the layout consists of a U-shaped counter and a few table seats. Generally, you are guided to the counter. Each seat has a tablet in front of it, and the tea served is powdered, similar to regular kaiten sushi places, so there wasn't a special feeling here. The numbered clips attached to the tablet screens are used for billing. You place your order on the tablet and then take this clip to the register to pay. I quickly selected my toppings on the tablet and ordered my sushi.Å° Yamako Hon Maguro Chutoro (JPY 680)The highlight here is the tuna from Yamako, and I ordered the chutoro first. It was served with soy sauce already applied. The chutoro had a melt-in-your-mouth flavor, and the portion was generous.Å° Aosa Miso Soup (JPY 350)After waiting for 20 minutes in the rain mixed with sleet, I was chilled to the bone and craved something warm, so I ordered the miso soup right away. The aosa seaweed added a nice flavor to the soup, providing a comforting moment.Å° Homemade Fish Head Soup (JPY 540)My wife ordered the fish head soup. I was pleased to find large pieces of fish head in it, and I wished I could have more.Å° Homemade Onodera Chawanmushi (JPY 560)The chawanmushi had a refreshing yuzu flavor, and the broth was delicious, leaving me wanting more.Å° Shimaaji (JPY 500)The beautiful shimaaji was thinly sliced, which I assume is characteristic of this fish.Å° Engawa (JPY 500)The engawa had a crunchy texture yet rich flavor.Å° Live Hokkigai (JPY 800)The highlight of the day for me was this hokkigai, which tasted incredibly fresh, as if it had just been prepared. There was no fishy smell, and the crunchy texture was delightful, even enjoying the siphon.Å° Akah Ebi (JPY 480)The rich flavor of the shrimp was delightful, and my husband was pleased.Å° Seafood Ehomaki (JPY 620)I visited during the Setsubun season, and when I saw the ehomaki on the menu, I ordered it. It was a luxurious roll topped with sea urchin, caviar, and salmon roe. It was a happy roll that included all the toppings I wanted to try.Å° Yamako Hon Maguro Nakao Gunkan (JPY 480)I ordered this to enjoy the nori as well. The nakao was delicious as it melted in my mouth.Å° Yamako Hon Maguro Tekka Hosomaki (JPY 780)I realized that the red meat was also very tasty.Å° Yamako Hon Maguro Chutoro (JPY 680)Finally, I was torn about what to eat next... and I decided on the chutoro again. I requested it to be made without soy sauce. I realized that enjoying it according to my preference was the best way to savor it.After all this, the total came to just over JPY 10,000. Considering it was a high-end sushi restaurant, I thought it was reasonably priced, but at this price point, visiting frequently would be difficult. The clear billing process is a definite advantage. The red vinegar rice had a strong flavor from the salt and vinegar, and the fact that it was served with soy sauce already applied might be a matter of personal preference."
A Touch of Luxury Sushi,"This is a very delicious sushi restaurant near the Apple Store in Omotesando.I visited for the second time.I went on a Saturday afternoon and arrived around 2 PM to get a numbered ticket.There were 45 groups waiting!! However, I was able to get in after about 1 hour and 30 minutes.Å® You can walk around Omotesando while waiting away from the restaurant.The seating is limited to 60 minutes, and you can pay individually.Although it's kaiten sushi, the sushi doesnÅft rotateorders are placed on a touch panel.They prepare the sushi fresh upon order!Prices range from approximately JPY 300 to JPY 2000 per plate.The medium fatty tuna, winter yellowtail, and sea bream were absolutely delicious and melted in my mouth!It was worth much more than the price paid. If you're shopping in Omotesando, definitely check it out!"
A taste of Onodera from abroad,"OmotesandoOn a Friday night, I had trouble finding a reservation, so I wandered around Omotesando, but I found this place where I could get a table if I waited! It was a walk-in.The interior is spacious, and the turnover is quick, so I didnÅft have to wait long. There were many international guests, and I didn't hear much Japanese.I usually enjoy eating mackerel and horse mackerel, but unfortunately, many items were sold out at night, so I ended up ordering tuna and medium fatty tuna repeatedly.Although itÅfs on the pricier side for conveyer sushi, it is definitely delicious!

We had to wait for a bit, but we were assigned to a table.The menu was extensive, which was a pleasant surprise, and we had a good selection of drinks. Personally, I preferred the other dishes over the tuna.The grilled mackerel was the best dish! There were many appetizers available, but the time limit was quite strict. This might be expected for a popular restaurant.It was a great meal!I will definitely come back if I have the chance!"
The character for food means to improve people; it signifies their betterment. @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,"""The conveyor has stopped, haha, at Kaiten Sushi Onodera""In recent years, the Onodera Group has gained a reputation by collaborating with Yamatsuki to procure the first tuna of the new year (Ichiban Maguro). This location combines Kaiten (conveyor belt) sushi and standing sushi bar in one place, which is situated in Omotesando. While strolling down Omotesando, I suddenly remembered and decided to visit for the first time since its opening.Despite being just before dinner peak time, there were already more than ten groups of foreigners waiting, haha. Still, I was able to enter relatively smoothly.ÅyAtmosphere of the restaurantÅzAs usual, it gives off a ""luxurious"" rather than ""high-end"" vibe, and it seems to cater to foreign customers, haha. After being seated, I was surprised to find that the familiar conveyor belt was not operating. Upon inquiring, I learned that they had changed from the conveyor belt system to a more traditional plate service style. The concept has shifted, haha...While such a comment may seem unnecessary, it seems like it turned out fine, haha. The reason for this change is that about 70% of the customers are foreigners, and it was also considered from a hygiene standpoint.ÅyOrder details at Kaiten Sushi OnoderaÅz Flatfish (JPY 350). Åõ Squid (JPY 300). Åõ Yamatsuki Hon Maguro Assorted (Otoro, Chutoro, Akami) (JPY 2000). Åõ Purple Sea Urchin (JPY 1100). Åõ Sprout Negi (JPY 210). Åõ Aosa Seaweed Soup from Ise-Shima (JPY 350). Å¢ Kanpyo Hosomaki (JPY 370). Å¢ Homemade Castella Egg (JPY 320). ÅõÅyFood impressionsÅzThe ""Tekka Maki"" I ordered was sold out,In the end, my total came to around JPY 5000, and considering the content, I think it was a good price. In terms of the sushi's quality, I believe it rivals the recently popular high-end standing sushi bars that charge between JPY 7000 and JPY 10000, thanks to their strong procurement power. However, since there are many customers, the execution was a bit messy. For example... while the red vinegar rice was on the smaller side, the cuts of fish varied significantly.If they could ensure a more uniform size and thickness, it would improve the overall experience.Additionally, the kanpyo was quite bland, and yet the wasabiÅfs sharpness was overwhelmingly strong, so it might be better to change the wasabi.ÅyServiceÅzThere was a new entertainment element introduced, where staff enthusiastically shout encouragement when serving drinks and dishes, which seems aimed at foreign customers. I couldn't help but worry, wondering what they would think of Japanese sushi!ÅyMiscellaneousÅzKaiten Sushi Onodera in Omotesando is thriving, recognized globally by foreigners. From a management perspective, my imagination suggests...that with an average customer spending of around JPY 6000, and assuming they receive between 250 and 300 customers daily, the monthly revenue would approximate JPY 40 million to JPY 50 million.It was a great meal!Åy(Revised) Personal evaluation points from 2025Åz(1) Due to recent trends in Tabelog, I find it increasingly hard to write honestly, so from 2025, I will evaluate dishes separately on a 3-point scale based on preference rather than good or bad. Åù Very Much to My LikingÅõ To My Liking or Close to My LikingÅ¢ Corresponding to Price or Not My Liking(2) Regarding overall scoring, starting in 2025, I will revise it as follows:3.0-3.4 is somewhat deviating from my preference.3.5-3.9 indicates a good restaurant with potential for repeat visits.4.0-4.4 indicates great satisfaction and certain repeat visitation.4.5-5.0 indicates a desire to visit at least four times a year.*Evaluation criteria may change in the future.Thank you for reading to the end. I would appreciate your likes, follows, and saving of the restaurant. Thank you very much!"
Seasonal items never disappoint!,"When I visited last time, I remembered it was a 90-minute limit, but this time it was surprisingly shortened to 60 minutes. The alcohol selection was great, so I would have preferred to enjoy my time leisurely. However, with only 60 minutes, it felt like we had to rush through like at a conveyor belt sushi chain, making the experience rather hectic. There were many tourists, and we also had to wait about an hour to get in, so I understand the need to increase the turnover rate, but I still hope they can at least return to a 90-minute limit.That said, the sushi was still fresh and delicious, especially the seasonal sea urchin and cod milt, which were exquisite. If you visit during this season, make sure to give them a try!"
First Experience at Onodera,"This year, I couldn't go to the top tuna spots, but finally made my way to Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera for my first meal of the new year!One significant change is that you can now make online reservations and obtain a waiting number, which I wasn't aware of, so I just walked in. Additionally, the standing counter has been replaced with two tables for four guests.Note: The chefs are not in front of you, as the waitstaff will bring your orders.Date: WeekendTime: Around 11:15 AMWaiting Number: Approximately 55Wait Time: I was called around 12:45 PM.You have 60 minutes at the table, but since the dishes come out quickly, I think youÅfll find it more than sufficient.The tuna is indeed exquisite! They offer seasonal selections that may not be available next time, so if you see something you want, donÅft hesitate to order!For example, the scallops we had that day were smaller because they're not in season, but they were stacked two together. However, they actually seemed larger than usual."

The best place to enjoy tuna*.,"My first post of the new year is about #The Best Tuna. I visited #Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in Omotesando. *This year, they had a 276kg tuna worth JPY 207 million (last year's was 236kg and JPY 114.24 million). My child loves tuna, so we've actually been enjoying the best tuna for three consecutive years. My husband went to get the ticket for us; he got it around 10 AM and we were in line at number 50. The opening got delayed and we finally got seated around 3 PM.  Two pieces of the first auction Yamako tuna for JPY 1,160  Handmade Ikura for JPY 650  Grilled live scallop with salt for JPY 850  Flounder for JPY 350 I'm so happy to enjoy Oma tuna again this year! Thank you to Onodera, Yamako, and all the tuna fishermen! I couldnÅft take a photo, but I also recommend the three-piece yellowtail set. *.It was a great meal! "
270 million... Truly amazing top-grade tuna,"Sushi SeriesTokyo Edition: VisitingKaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Store in OmotesandoI had been curious about this sushi restaurant, but hadnÅft had the opportunity to go until now. However, every year at the start, the first maguro (tuna) becomes a hot topic, and I always wanted to try it. But I hesitated due to the rumored absurd wait times. This year, though, the tuna looked incredibly appealingit made me want to try it even if it meant waiting a little.Rumor had it that the wait could be up to 10 hours, but when I arrived just after noon, I registered at the machine.It indicated a 6-hour wait for about 80 groups, so I thought to come back in the evening. Yet, while checking the wait information on the app, it seemed to be progressing faster than expected, so I didnÅft venture too far and wandered nearby instead. As it turned out, my wait was about 2 hours, so timing was good.Although there is a conveyor belt at Kaiten Sushi, it wasn't in operation. Orders were placed via a touch panel, and I noticed some newcomers struggling to navigate it. It seems many first-time customers were present. I found the ordering process convenient, but I wished the screen was a bit more intuitive for placing orders.Now, let's get to the crucial part: my impressions of the sushi. I ordered the first maguro, Yamako Hon Maguro, 2 pieces for JPY 1,160 (the cost price is reportedly JPY 30,000 for one piece). Also, I had the Yamako Nakaochi Temaki for JPY 2,000.The first item to arrive was the hand roll, overflowing with nakaochi. It's the best hand roll I've ever had. Next came the two pieces of maguro. This set included Akami (lean tuna) and Chutoro (medium fatty tuna), with a limit of one serving per person. The akami was absolutely outstandingIÅfve never had anything quite like it; it was incredibly delicious. I felt like I could wait hours for this level of flavor.Next, I tried the chutoro, but the delightful taste of the akami slightly overshadowed its impact. Nonetheless, the chutoro was also wonderfully delicious. My satisfaction level was MAXjust outstanding!My first experience with the first maguro and Yamakothank you, Onodera! I appreciate it."
 Delicious Omakase Tuna from Oma! ^_^/,"Thank you for always taking a look! ^_^/Your support through follows, likes, and comments will motivate me further. I appreciate it!

Just had the first auctioned tuna of the season!,"I had the pleasure of enjoying the first tuna auction from Toyosu Market in 2025, fetching an astonishing JPY 207 million! I got to try the top-grade tuna at Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera.I received a numbered ticket, and the wait time was about 6 hoursÅcBut it was so worth it to taste something so exclusive!*Note: There is a limit of 2 pieces per person for the tuna.I also indulged in an array of other dishes:Sea urchin tasting of Bafun and Murasaki,Kohada,Shirasu Gunkan,Amaebi,Stewed Anago,Herb Onion,Shima Aji,and many more! It was a great meal!"
Delicious options beyond just tuna!,"I regularly visit Yamako to enjoy their tuna. This time, I had a variety of tuna (lean, medium fatty, fatty, and hand rolls with fatty tuna), but I was disappointed that they didn't have the marinated tuna and medium fatty tuna hand rolls available. However, the sweet shrimp, shako (mantis shrimp), and kohada (gizzard shad) were all incredibly delicious. In particular, the sakura buri (cherry salmon, in season?) was exceptionally good this time. As usual, I started with some appetizers and beer, but the limited spring sake was delightful. It was a great meal!"
Delicious Tuna from Yamako,"Kaiten Sushi Onodera is located just a short walk from Omotesando Station. I visited after a while on a weekday around 4 PM and found a line mostly with tourists. I waited for about 20 minutes to be seated. Onodera is known for its tuna, so I ordered the red meat tuna, and it was just as delicious as I remembered. I even ordered a second helping! While the prices are on the higher side for kaiten sushi, it's a good option if you want to enjoy quality sushi. Just be cautious of the busy times."
Not just tuna,"They source their tuna from Yama Ko, which is delicious, but the shirako (cod milt) was also fantastic. It's affordable and tasty, making it extremely popular, so be prepared for a long wait. Since it's a kaiten sushi restaurant, the turnover is good, but due to the influx of inbound tourists, it can get quite crowded, so be ready for that."

"Highly popular among inbound visitors, reservations recommended","Visited in December 2024 on a weekday and waited about an hour. On weekends, the wait can stretch to 2-3 hours, so making a reservation is recommended.The clientele seems to have a majority of inbound tourists, which reflects effective marketing. Every piece of sushi was delicious, but the tuna sourced from Yamako was especially flavorful!While there is a conveyor belt, it is not in use; sushi is served directly made to order. The staff is plentiful, the restaurant is clean, and the atmosphere is pleasant.Prices range from JPY 500 to JPY 1000 per piece, so it's not exactly cheap, but the quality is guaranteed.

Conveyor Belt Sushi Without the Conveyor in Omotesando,"I've visited several times but apparently never posted about it.I aimed to arrive at Omotesando around 7 PM and got there by 6:30. When I tried to check in online, the system was down. I dashed from Omotesando Hills to the restaurant to check in and found out there was a 160-minute wait. The standing sushi bar was closed for preparation. When I asked the staff, I learned it would open at 7 PM, so I stood by the ticket machine. Miraculously, I was seated right at opening.The ordering system had changed to smartphone ordering by scanning a QR code from the touch panel.I started placing my orders from my phone, and the deliciousness was as expected.

Overall high quality,"There was a mix-up with my order, but overall the food is delicious.It's not the typical quality you'd expect from kaiten sushi.The chu-toro (medium fatty tuna) is especially outstanding. The akami (red meat) had a slight fishy smell, though...The ikura (salmon roe) paired perfectly with the soy sauce."
Kaiten Sushi featuring top-quality tuna from Yamako!,"Just a 3-minute walk from Omotesando Station, I made my first visit to a highly talked-about kaiten sushi restaurant featuring Yamako's tuna. At Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, you can easily enjoy Edo-style sushi techniques with a casual conveyor belt experience. The flavor exceeded my expectations for a typical kaiten sushi place.You don't need a reservation; you can just line up to enjoy the meal, which means it attracts a lot of inbound customers. In Kansai, there are already branches like ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Osaka"" and ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Kyoto,"" with the Osaka location offering seat reservations.Ordered items: Yamako Hon Maguro Akami House-made Kohada House-made Boiled Anago Yamako Hon Maguro Chutoro Yamako Hon Maguro Akami Zuke Yamako Hon Maguro Torotaku Hosomaki House-made Ankimo Gunkan Shima Aji Ebi Mayo Gunkan Anago Cucumber HosomakiThe highlight was undoubtedly the nigiri made with Yamako's Hon Maguro! I tried various tuna dishes, including Chutoro, Akami, Zuke, and Torotaku hosomaki, and they were rich and surprisingly delicious! The Yamako Hon Maguro Chutoro melted in my mouthpure joy!The cuts were generously sized, with the Kohada nearly hiding the rice! The rice was firm and red, which felt unusual for kaiten sushi. There were also interesting varieties, like the Ankimo gunkan. By the way, is it just me that craves mayo-style gunkans when I visit a kaiten sushi? The Ebi Mayo Gunkan was delicious! #omotesando #SUSHI #sushitime #sushilovers #KaitenSushiGinzaOnodera #sushi #GinzaSushi #TokyoGourmet #OmotesandoGourmet #kaitenSushi #TokyoSushi #TokyoKaitenSushi #SushiLovers #Omotesando #OmotesandoLunch #Yamako #YamakoTuna #Torotaku #TorotakuMaki #Chutoro #Ankimo #Tuna"

Omotesando: Not Your Average Kaiten Sushi at Onodera,"I visited the famous Kaiten Sushi Onodera in Omotesando, known for its rotating sushi, which is a version of Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera.It was my first time going there, and I saw a long wait with mostly foreign customers. I almost gave up, but then I noticed there were about six counter seats available, and they said I could be seated right away.ItÅfs not a conveyor-belt sushi place, and although the prices are a bit higher, the quality is worth it. Without hesitation, I entered.The sushi is on par with high-end establishments.It was absolutely delicious.I appreciated being able to order freely via a tablet instead of a fixed course.In fact, I even thought that rather than high-priced fine dining sushi, it might be better to enjoy a few pieces of delicious sushi here in a more casual manner from now on.I was fully satisfied!"

Exceptional Tuna at Yamako,"This place is extremely popular, especially among foreigners. It operates on a ticket system, but it gets quite crowded on weekends, so it's better to get your ticket in advance and spend some time elsewhere.The sushi here is delicious, and itÅfs on a different level than typical conveyor belt sushi. The tuna from Yamako is exceptionally tasty, and it's worth coming just for that. The seasonal yellowtail was also delicious.While the prices are somewhat high, I believe the satisfaction level is greater than that of many upscale restaurants."
Premium Kaiten Sushi,"This is a high-end kaiten sushi restaurant located in Omotesando.It's pricier than the typical conveyor belt sushi, and I had always wanted to visit, so I finally came here!About 90% of the customers were foreigners.It was definitely catering to inbound tourists.I recommend making a reservation through the app rather than checking in at the restaurant!I was able to enter in about 40 minutes.Regarding the sushi, each plate has one piece!The portions are large, which really increases the satisfaction.The staff is also lively, creating a great atmosphere!Personally, I found the akagai (red clam) and kohada (shad) to be delicious, and I ended up ordering them multiple times (laughs).The sushi rice is red rice, so it has some flavor on its own, allowing me to enjoy the taste without adding much soy sauce!It was a great meal!"
A Must-Visit Kaiten Sushi Destination,"It was my first visit in a while. I truly appreciate the ability to wait for my turn using the app. Upon returning, I noticed there are many foreign tourists; it seems to have become a popular sightseeing spot. The prices, flavors, and atmosphere seem to have changed since my last visit, possibly due to the increase in tourists. I didn't feel as impressed as I did before."
A popular kaiten sushi restaurant in the Ura-Harajuku area,"On the last day of my trip to Tokyo, I chose this restaurant. It seems that reservations arenÅft accepted, so I had to wait about 30 minutes to get in. ThereÅfs also standing sushi on the front side, it seems. The ordering style is unique, unlike the typical conveyor belt sushi. Every dish I tried was delicious. About 90% of the customers were foreign tourists. Given the location, itÅfs impressive that they decided to open a conveyor sushi restaurant here."
Seeing is believing,"Just a 4-minute walk from Omotesando Station.I visited on a Friday at 9 PM. Reservations weren't available, so I had to pull a numbered ticket at the entrance and wait. They call you when your turn is close, even if you're away from the restaurant.It was quite busy with inbound tourists, but while strolling around Omotesando, I was guided in about 15 minutes!The fish used here seems to be of high quality, though the prices are on the higher side.There are also attractions that tourists would enjoy, so if anyone wants to go, I might join them.It was a great meal!"
A fun performance! Authentic Edomae Sushi at Kaiten Sushi,"Experience authentic Edomae sushi in a conveyor belt style at Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera - the perfect place for a sushi dinner.This popular restaurant was almost fully booked at 5 PM on a weekday. Every piece of fresh sushi was delicious. The homemade anago (grilled eel) was fluffy and tender!The seared engawa (flounder fin) was so good that I ordered it three times. Both the a la carte fried shira-obi (cod roe) and fried octopus were also delightful.The ongoing performances were entertaining, and my son excitedly joined in!  The ultra-fresh sushi I ordered during the performance was truly exceptional, and I highly recommend trying it!With many kid-friendly sushi options and a variety of a la carte dishes, the whole family can enjoy the experience. It was nice to see that they offer juice for children and have diaper-changing stations in the restroom, making it very welcoming for families.The restaurant not only has conveyor belt sushi, but also counter seating and private rooms, making it very versatile. It was incredibly popular among international guests as well!"
Premium Kaiten Sushi,"Many dishes are priced over JPY 1000 each! But they're delicious! I was so excited to see so much shirako (cod milt)! Even though I made a reservation, it was super crowded! It's definitely best to make a reservation well in advance. I want to come back! I highly recommend the Botan shrimp, tuna, and uni."
First Experience at a High-End Kaiten Sushi,"Enjoying the quality of a high-end sushi restaurant in Ginza at accessible prices. I had wanted to visit this place for a long time due to that enticing claim.I arrived on a weekday at 1:30 PM and waited with three people ahead of me. It seemed there were available seats, but they were struggling to keep up with the cleaning...I was seated after about 10 minutes.On this day, I was determined to indulge in delicious food without holding back, so I ordered a total of JPY 15,000! But surprisingly, I find it hard to remember any standout dishes that truly left an impression...The premium bluefin tuna from Yamakou was certainly delicious! It was tasty, but somehowÅcMaybe it was the rolls that stood out more?Hmm, that's about the price of a round of golfÅcAbout 10 times more than the usual JPY 100 sushiÅcThree times more than an already slightly luxurious sushi restaurantÅcThereÅfs no denying it was delicious, but I didnÅft feel that special touch. The hospitality was quite averageÅc The staff at Choumaru was more attentive and friendly with smilesÅc The sushi chefs seemed incredibly busy and somewhat stressedÅcPerhaps my expectations were set too high... The rice at high-end sushi places is al dente (dry and firm)!The shrimp mayo was pretty standard!I learned a lot today!Over one-third of the customers were inbound visitors.I had a good experience!!"
"Exceptional Bluefin Tuna, Botan Shrimp, and Sea Urchin.","I visited this place for a study on high-end sushi. However, true upscale sushi restaurants often come with a high barrier to entry, so I opted for Kaiten Sushi. I wondered if the hon-maguro (bluefin tuna) at Yamako would be as delicious as the rumors claimed.- Hon-Maguro from YamakoThe cuts are thick, allowing me to truly savor the rich flavor of the tuna. While I've previously found that the freshest and most delicious tuna comes right after a fish-cutting demonstration, this one had a melt-in-your-mouth sweetness that was on another level. This is fantastic.- Botan Ebi (Sweet Shrimp)I tried several types of shrimp, including kuruma ebi, botan ebi, akai ebi, and steamed shrimp, but botan ebi was definitely the best.- Uni (Sea Urchin)I had two pieces for comparison. The quality was evident just by looking at themthe shape of the grains was different from what I usually see. Each piece offered a distinct flavor, allowing me to truly enjoy the excellence of uni.Other toppings were also impressive, as expected from high-end sushi. However, I found the rice a bit mysterious. While I was very satisfied with the fluffy texture provided by the chef using red vinegar, the rice grains felt slightly firm. When I sampled just one grain, it had an al dente texture similar to risotto. Hmmm. Is it a rule that high-end sushi should have firmer rice? Or was I just fortunate to encounter a specific cooking style?That's all for my sushi study. Thank you for the delicious meal!"
Premium Kaiten Sushi,"After getting a haircut, I found out that the main branch of Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera is nearby, so I decided to visit! There were only a handful of Japanese patrons, as most customers were foreigners! I didn't let that bother me, and I enjoyed several pieces of sushi, which were so delicious that I would love to come back every day if it were closer!

Delicious,"What's included in the recommended set?A thrilling trio of sushi!This was my first time ordering it, and I got two sets with completely different pieces!Absolutely amazing!!!I'll definitely order this every time from now on!The bluefin tuna was fantastic!I also ordered grilled collar, but this time the fat felt a bit too rich."
"Michelin One-Star Supervised, Non-Conveyor High-End Sushi","On Friday, I arrived at 10:30 AM and immediately seated despite a couple of groups already being there. I was excited to try the Otoro (fatty tuna) from Ooma in such a casual atmosphere.Orders are placed via tablets at each table, and sushi is delivered to your seat on plates, much like at a conveyor belt sushi place. It was quite a surreal sight to see a conveyor belt without any sushi flowing on it, haha!Since it was my first visit, I decided to indulge a bit and ordered 19 different types of sushi, one piece each, along with two rolls, which really filled me up. I also had sparkling wine and draft beer, finishing with a miso soup, totaling about JPY 14,000.If it were a high-end restaurant, the bill could easily reach around JPY 25,000. While the quality and execution differ, I often go to Uokiji Nihonichi and it gives a similar satisfaction for about JPY 7,000.Overall, it felt a bit pricey. Given that a piece of the Ooma medium fatty tuna costs around JPY 650, it might be better to enjoy the tuna for about JPY 5,000 to JPY 6,000 and leave in a flash.It was a great meal!"

"Delicious tuna, truly a top-tier kaiten sushi restaurant.","From the Omotesando intersection, head towards Harajuku and turn left at the next alley. At 2 PM on a weekday, thereÅfs no wait, but itÅfs almost full. More than half of the guests are undoubtedly international visitors.Of course, I started with the tuna. The lean cut is rich in flavor, and both the medium-fat and fatty tuna are superbly delicious. For reference, the prices are JPY 420 for the lean, JPY 620 for the medium-fat, and JPY 930 for the fatty tuna, per piece.The rice was a bit hard and crumbled when I tried to eat it with chopsticks, so I decided to wash my hands and eat with my fingers after using hand sanitizer.The sanma (mackerel pike) wasnÅft very fresh, but the boiled shrimp was quite good. The pickled mackerel and salmon belly were just okay.Personally, I thought the lean tuna was the best, so I ordered two pieces along with the toro-taku roll, and it was reliably delicious.However, the miso soup with Aosa seaweed had almost no seaweed in it as seen in the photo, and the broth tasted rather weak, so I had just one sip and left it.For dessert, I had a dessert wine from Katsunuma called Argano. I wished it had a bit more volume.After all this, the bill for two of us exceeded JPY 20,000. It was delicious, but as expected for such a luxury conveyor belt sushi restaurant."
Delicious sushi at a fair price,"I visited on a weekday evening! I heard there was a kaiten sushi restaurant at Ginza Onodera, so I decided to check it out!!I went around 6 PM, so there was no wait!!The counter seating was quite empty!Table seating depended on the timing!!Ordering is done entirely through a touch panel, and no plates were rotating! Sushi was made to order right away!!I raised a glass of beer while ordering red vinegar sushi one after another! The freshness was outstanding and it was really delicious, but it might be on the pricier side for kaiten sushi!That said, I thoroughly enjoyed it!It was a great meal!With this quality, I would definitely come back!!IÅfll be visiting again!"
A must-try when craving sushi in Omotesando!,"At 8:00 PM on a weekday, I registered online for my turn and waited for about 40 minutes.The cost performance isn't great, but it's definitely tasty.What I ordered:- Chutoro (Medium Fatty Tuna)- Scallops- Sea Bream- Kombu Roll- Thick Roll- Kanpachi (Amberjack)- Ramen- Matcha Monaka Ice CreamI probably wouldnÅft come here specifically for sushi, but it could be a good option if you find yourself craving sushi in Omotesando."
Kaiten Sushi at Ginza Onodera!,"I previously visited Kaiten Sushi Onodera, but the wait time was incredible! It seemed like there were many foreign customers, and since the prices were high, I didnÅft think I would return.However, when I casually stopped by the standing sushi bar, I noticed the queue moved faster than at the kaiten sushi. I only waited about 15 minutes on a Sunday evening. Being able to watch the sushi being made right in front of me made the taste different and delicious. I definitely want to go back here.I ordered:Ikura,2 plates of Tai,2 plates of Chutoro,Anago Tempura,Chutoro Maki,for about JPY 4000. It was a bit pricey, but I really enjoyed my meal at a leisurely pace."
Affordable and Delicious Sushi in Omotesando,"A coworker's family came from abroad for summer vacation. Since they have a child who prefers fish over meat, we decided to choose the premium kaiten sushi.As we couldn't make a reservation in advance, we registered through the app at 6:30 PM and found out there were 23 groups ahead of us. When we arrived at 7 PM, we confirmed our registration and got an estimate of the waiting time.We had to wait about 40 minutes, so we took a stroll with my coworker's family down Takeshita Street to pass the time. Since we registered through the app, we received a call and email as our reservation time approached.Once inside, we placed our orders via a tablet. There were many inbound customers, so the system was available in English, Chinese, and Korean.It was unfortunate that the sushi didn't rotate, possibly due to the pandemic's impact. The tuna they are famous for was excellent, and the anago (sea eel) prepared at their main store in Ginza was delicious as well. I would love to come back for a more leisurely visit next time."
"Not worth making a reservation... Cheaper than the counter, but better than big chain sushi? A bit of a mixed experience...","First visit! I waited online for about an hour. I had other plans, so it was a side visit, but I didn't really feel it was worth the effort to come here.There are other conveyor sushi places that offer higher quality in both price and taste, so I don't think this place is necessary. The flavor felt rather mediocre while the prices were quite firmperhaps it's just a location fee aimed at tourists?I tried various items, but here are just a few highlights:Å¢ Chutoro was disappointing due to too many sinews.Å¢ Squid was so tough I couldn't chew through it...Å¸ Sweet shrimp was okay.Å¢ Bonito had delightful condiments, but they overpowered the fish's flavor with the sauce.Å¢ Anago was fluffy but the fat content was average, and the sweet sauce didn't suit my taste.Å¢ Kohada was over-marinated, losing its charm.Å¢ Flounder marinated in kombu had too strong a kombu flavor, overshadowing the fish's qualitymore kombu than umami.Å¸ Nakaochi Gunkan was delicious!Å¸ Quail Egg Nakaochi Gunkan was also tasty!Å¢ Toro-Taku Hosomaki was thin and had only a little filling, so I didn't find it very enjoyable... What a shame.Å¸ Toro-Taku Temaki had a greater portion of ingredients and was very deliciousthough it felt like something I could easily make at home myself."
Luxurious 3 Assorted Nigiri by the Chef's Whim!,"Although it's located in Omotesando, I decided to drop by #Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera when it looked empty.Fortunately, I got the timing just right as a line started forming behind me.The interior has a sparkling vibe that seems to appeal to foreigners.Ordering is done via tablet.I ordered the #Kimagure 3 Pieces twice, and it did take a bit of time...But the contents were different for both  It's true kimagure!á@ Salmon with karasumi, shrimp, and tuna over rice with gold leafáA Aburi salmon, squid, and ikura seafood bowlIt was delicious!I enjoyed just the dishes I wanted to trythis is one of the great things about kaiten sushi.The chutoro (medium fatty tuna) was so tasty!"
Utilizing the Counter Area Right in Front,"Since the kaiten sushi was crowded, I opted for the standing sushi bar next door (which has chairs). They serve different types of sushi that you won't find at the kaiten sushi, and most importantly, you can enjoy freshly made sushi right in front of you, which I highly recommend. You can also order items from the kaiten sushi menu via the touch panel. The tuna was exceptional. I want to eat it again. It was a great meal! ------------------------------ I'm also updating my Instagram  @tokyo_arimon"
Irresistible Kaiten Sushi,"I was drawn in even though I wasn't hungry. Today, I ordered everything with small rice servings. On weekdays during lunchtime, there's usually seating available. The restaurant maintains its lively atmosphere. The slightly firm rice, seasoned with red vinegar, was delicious and melted in my mouth. I didnÅft take any photos since I was too overwhelmed, but aside from the shrimp mayonnaise, the dishes were surprisingly authentic and highly recommended. Also, the shellfish was delicious; it was good the last time too. The fish bone soup was more of a clear soup than a traditional fish bone miso soup, lacking in flavor. It was so light that I got worried about the chawanmushi being too bland, so I decided to skip it. I will definitely come back again."
The level of Chutoro... Impressive!!,"This was delicious.Especially the medium fatty tuna was on a level that surpasses typical conveyor belt sushi; I was completely captivated. I want to go every day...In the area with the conveyor belt, there are many inbound customers, but in the back, there are private rooms with two tables for six, allowing a maximum of 12 people to enjoy sushi while having a relaxed conversation."
"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera: Delicious, high-quality tuna and exceptional vinegared rice.","Located just a 3-minute walk from Omotesando Station, this kaiten sushi restaurant is a branch of Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, offering a surprisingly high level of sushi in a casual setting.Despite being a kaiten sushi, the price per piece ranges from JPY 400 to over JPY 1000, but the quality is exceptional, featuring tuna sourced from Yamakou and other ingredients that stand out from typical kaiten sushi.I was particularly impressed by:Medium fatty tuna: Its sweetness was outstanding.Mackerel: The fat was comparable to that of toro.Whelk: The crunchy texture was amazing.Sea urchin: Absolutely no unpleasant smell, just strong sweetness and aroma.They also have several premium Japanese sakes, including Saku and Kaze no Mori. The tasting set of three Kaze no Mori sakes included the Omachi label, which had a rich aroma reminiscent of bananas, paired with a crisp finish.I believe this place successfully balances convenience and taste. It was a great meal!"
Easily seated before 3 PM on Saturday,"Saturday, 14:49. I decided to try this popular spot that usually has a long wait. I thought the odd timing might mean a smooth experience, but surprisingly, there was still a bit of a line. The neighboring standing sushi bar (which has seating) also uses a ticket system. Given that the kaiten sushi place had significantly more seats, I opted for the kaiten sushi and got a ticket. Immediately after, I received a call and was seated in less than 10 minutes. About 70-80% of the customers around me were from abroad. They serve premium draft beer, and you have to order the ginger. All the sushi was delicious. At one point, there was a fresh fish cutting time, and I quickly placed an order. They refill the Japanese sake upon request. However, the pickled water eggplant I ordered as an appetizer was rather disappointing. Despite the sushi being reasonably priced for a high-end Ginza establishment, the atmosphere still felt like a kaiten sushi place. I might not have the motivation to come back again."
The sushi here is outstanding,"ItÅfs been a while since my last visit!I returned to Onodera near Omotesando Station.I ordered the following dishes:- Medium fatty tuna (Chutoro)- Seared fatty tuna (Aburi)- Nakaochi (tuna scraps)- Sea urchin (Uni)- Squid (Ika)- Salmon- Tekka Maki (Tuna Roll)- Broiled eel (Anago)ItÅfs still busy as usual, but itÅfs definitely worth the wait!"
Tuna from Yamako at Kaiten Sushi!,"For four consecutive years, Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera has earned a Michelin star.Despite being a conveyor-belt sushi restaurant, the sushi does not actually rotate. Instead, once you order via the tablet, the skilled sushi chef prepares your selection right in front of you.All the tuna comes from Yamako. ItÅfs amazing to be able to enjoy Yamako's tuna at a conveyor-belt sushi restaurant!Some reviews mention that the tuna here is of lower quality compared to other Yamako offerings, but I found it to be quite delicious for the price.I enjoyed both the fatty tuna (otoro) and medium fatty tuna (chutoro) (I forgot to take a picture of the otoro...). Even within the same cuts, some pieces had more fat striations than others, which adds a nice aspect typical of conveyor-belt sushi.The option to have less rice is also a nice touch.The lively atmosphere is one of their highlights, with several mini shows happening throughout the hour I was there.The sushi chef was very skilled, preparing the sushi beautifully.Access is excellent, just a one-minute walk from Omotesando Station. I visited around 12:30 PM during lunch, and I was lucky to get in with almost no wait.I plan to return whenever I find a less busy time."
Take Away Available,"I got take away sushi from Onodera for a soccer match at the National Stadium this time.I ordered two sets of nigiri and one maki, which came to about JPY 10,000.The sushi from Onodera tasted exceptional at the stadium. This was my first time trying this method, and I would definitely recommend it.I apologize, but the katsu sandwich is a separate purchase  I got tempted and bought it along the way."

Luxury Kaiten Sushi in Omotesando,"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera is a high-end conveyor belt sushi restaurant located in Omotesando. I wondered why the main store is in Aoyama when it is called Ginza, but it turns out that the true main location of Onodera is indeed in Ginza.This trendy spot is known for its high-quality sushi on the conveyor belt, prepared by skilled sushi chefs using fresh ingredients.Occasionally, there are events where different fish disassembly shows take place right in front of you, allowing you to order freshly prepared fish.The experience here is far beyond that of typical conveyor belt sushi. However, it's priced somewhat high, so you might be surprised if you expect a regular conveyor belt sushi experience."
Kaiten Sushi in Omotesando!!,"While walking, I discovered an incredibly captivating building! A high-end kaiten sushi restaurant! But surprisingly, the prices aren't that high! I was almost drawn in without hesitation! Thank you for the delicious sushi. I'd love to visit again! It was a great meal."
Popular Kaiten Sushi with Many International Guests,"I discovered a ticket system for waiting in line right in front of the cash register.There are two types of sushi: Kaiten (conveyor belt) sushi and standing sushi. When I visited, there were 20 groups waiting for Kaiten sushi and 5 groups for standing sushi.Thinking that waiting less would be better, I took a ticket for the standing sushi, but it seems there were more openings in the Kaiten sushi section, so I was directed there.Upon further inquiry, I learned that the standing sushi only has seven seats, resulting in slow turnover. Plus, despite being called standing sushi, the presence of chairs makes it even slower.I could see how many groups were ahead of me on my smartphone, but I was curious as to why the number fluctuated. It turns out that sometimes a customer returns after being skipped when they weren't available when called.As for the sushi, while it appears they're sourcing fresh ingredients, most of the white fish didn't seem to exhibit the traditional Edomae preparation; the quality at Onodera's other branch, Trymon, was better for the same price range. I thought the tunaÅfs red meat and marinated pieces were acceptable."
First Visit,"I arrived at around 7:30 PM on Saturday and waited for my turn using the touch panel inside the restaurant. The turnover was quite fast, and my turn came in less than 30 minutes. The customer base was about half Japanese and half tourists. There was a wide variety of dishes, and they were all very delicious. However, personally, I felt that the prices didn't quite match the quality, considering how reasonable it was. Still, everything was tasty."
"Honestly, I couldn't figure out what was good.","I was recommended by friends to visit this place!I went on a weekday around 7:30 PM and there was no wait!Most of the customers were from overseas.The prices are similar to Choshi-maru in Chiba.The tuna was delicious!The drink menu was interesting, but the excitement didnÅft last long.There were very few desserts and limited  la carte options.They have high-end items like abalone and grouper, but they were fishy and not tasty.I could eat the sea urchin, but it wasn't good.The chawanmushi (steamed egg custard) was average.I think the rice was stable, but I didnÅft really notice the flavor of akazu (red vinegar). I prefer the strong taste of Fuji vinegar.I usually go to conveyor belt sushi like Kappa Sushi or Sushiro, but I've also been to counter-only sushi restaurants that cost around JPY 30,000 per person.I don't think I'll return to a place with such a mediocre price and quality."
Experience the flavors of a high-end sushi restaurant in Ginza,"When it comes to high-end sushi restaurants in Ginza, prices are usually in the tens of thousands. It's a blessing that I can enjoy it here for just a few thousand yen.Moreover, the tuna is sourced from Yamako, so I highly recommend trying their tuna. YouÅfll find the fatty tuna, medium fatty tuna, and lean cuts available, as well as grilled options and gunkan.The striped jack was freshly filleted and incredibly delicious due to its freshness.The sweet shrimp was also creamy, and the shrimp heads were deep-fried, making them edible.I finished off the meal with some hosomaki (thin rolls)."
First Experience at Onodera,"This year, I couldn't go to the top tuna spots, but finally made my way to Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera for my first meal of the new year!One significant change is that you can now make online reservations and obtain a waiting number, which I wasn't aware of, so I just walked in. Additionally, the standing counter has been replaced with two tables for four guests.Note: The chefs are not in front of you, as the waitstaff will bring your orders.Date: WeekendTime: Around 11:15 AMWaiting Number: Approximately 55Wait Time: I was called around 12:45 PM.You have 60 minutes at the table, but since the dishes come out quickly, I think youÅfll find it more than sufficient.The tuna is indeed exquisite! They offer seasonal selections that may not be available next time, so if you see something you want, donÅft hesitate to order!For example, the scallops we had that day were smaller because they're not in season, but they were stacked two together. However, they actually seemed larger than usual."
Non-Rotating Sushi at Onodera,"Every time I come to Omotesando, IÅfve been curious about this place. After dinner or not being able to align my timing, I finally got lucky to find it mostly empty on a weekday evening, so I decided to enter.Even at an early hour, it was nearly full, with a lot of foreign patrons and a lively atmosphere.You place your orders entirely through the tablet at your seat, and I noticed they had tuna from Yamako, so I of course ordered that along with several other dishes.Each piece of tuna from Yamako is served individually, which might make it feel slightly overpriced overall; however, I believed the quality would be worth it, so I ordered medium-fatty, lean, and marinated to compare the flavors.Eating quickly, I spent about JPY 3000. Hmm, it really feels quite upscale for a conveyor sushi restaurant! But given that it's not actually conveyor sushi at all, this might be fair pricing after all!IÅfd be really happy if foreign visitors could easily enjoy authentic Japanese sushi and come to appreciate it through this experience!"
Kaiten Sushi at Onodera!,"Located near Omotesando Station, Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera offers both conveyor belt sushi and standing sushi, with a more extensive menu available on the conveyor belt side.When I visited around 3-4 PM, I was able to enter with just a short wait.Their tuna is sourced from ""Yama K,"" so the tuna is a must-try."
A bit lacking in flavor...,"I visited the ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" located in Omotesando, but I was somewhat disappointed with the taste of the sushi.Although it positions itself as a high-end kaiten sushi restaurant, I didn't feel any sense of special quality in terms of the freshness of the ingredients and the quality of the rice.The fish didn't seem as fresh as I expected, and the flavor wasn't as satisfying. The tuna was a bit tough.Additionally, the staff's service felt somewhat cold, and perhaps because they seemed busy, there were moments where their efficiency felt lacking. Given that itÅfs a kaiten sushi style restaurant, some of this is understandable, but a little more attentive service would have significantly increased my satisfaction.Since it's located in Omotesando, it may be suitable for tourists or those who want to experience it at least once. However, avid sushi lovers might find it somewhat lacking."
"The best is the Surf Clam, and the Tuna is...","I've been to Onodera in Ginza once before. I didn't have lunch and went to the hair salon, then stopped by around 4 PM when it was less crowded. Perhaps because it was a weekday, there were many solo diners, creating a relaxed atmosphere.I tried:- Aji (Horse Mackerel)- Fresh Salmon- Hokkigai (Surf Clam)- Medium Fatty Tuna from Yamazaki- Toro-Taku (Fatty Tuna with Minced Daikon) from YamazakiI had never tried the tuna from Yamazaki, so I ordered it out of curiosity, but the medium fatty tuna at Tachigui Sushi Akira was overwhelmingly better. After researching, I found out that Tachigui Sushi Akira also uses Yamazaki tuna. I wonder if they process it differently. The Hokkigai was huge, with a great texture, and incredibly delicious.Overall, this meal cost JPY 3,280."

Casual and Accessible Kaiten Sushi,"Despite it being a Thursday afternoon, the restaurant was bustling with tourists from abroad. Thanks to my reservation, I was seated almost immediately. I highly recommend making a reservation.I was extremely satisfied with the tuna from Yamako. The red clam and the sweet shrimp were excellent recommendations. The sweet shrimp is incredibly fresh, taken directly from the live tank. I finished off with some ramen. The location is also convenient, making it a perfect spot for a quick meal while shopping. It was a great meal!"
A restaurant with mixed reviews,"Maya Ko Hon-toroYama Ko Akami MarinadeYama Ko Chu-toroYama Ko Toro Taku MakiAori IkaKohadaSteamed ShrimpOolong TeaAll of this was around JPY 4,500.I had high expectations because it was from Yama Ko, but it seems like I got the least tasty tuna they offer, whether it was the fish itself or the skill of the chef.I've tried Yama Ko's tuna at various places, and this was the least impressive.There were four male staff members behind the counter; one had long, brown hair, one had piercings, and another was making unfunny comments and acting foolishly, which was very unpleasant. With so many inbound tourists around, I really don't want them to think this represents Japanese sushi.It's disappointing that despite the strong branding of Onodera, this was the experience.Additionally, another staff member showed up later and was loudly discussing shift shortages, which was unprofessional.The sushi was not delicious, the staff were not good, and the prices were high.The quality is comparable to conveyor sushi in Hokkaido, but with higher prices and worse service.On the positive side, there were many payment options available.Also, it was nice to get a phone call when it was my turn.Other than that, there was not much to appreciate.There's no need to discuss the details of the sushi."
Delicious but pricey,"The liver of the triggerfish was incredibly delicious.The chu-toro (medium-fat tuna) was too cold on the outside; was it defrosted?The sweet shrimp lost its flavor when dipped in the sweet sauce.The tender boiled octopus was delightful.The egg castella was also delicious; I really liked the balance of sweetness.The marinated tuna had a bit too much redness for my taste (I generally don't like red meat).The tuna wasn't great overall.The chu-toro was too cold as well, so I couldn't taste it."

The Pinnacle of Kaiten Sushi in Tokyo,"This is the kaiten sushi that I've seen on social media featuring celebrities and nightlife! In reality, it doesn't rotate; you order from a tablet right in front of you, and they bring your selections directly!Well, be prepared to wait! LaughingThere are an incredible number of foreign tourists, and even for a single person, waiting 20 to 30 minutes is quite common!As for the food, it is not the kind of quality you'd expect from using a tablet, but the tuna from Yamako, which feels like high-end sushi, along with all the fresh toppings, was simply delicious!This is definitely a place I will visit again!The hand-rolled toro-taku was just... the best!It was a great meal!"
Weekend Lunch Delight,"I visited for a holiday lunch, and as expected, there were many foreign customers due to the location.This wasn't the case before, but recently the place has been bustling with tourists.The wait time for lunch was about an hour.I recommend checking in first and then exploring the area.The sushi was, of course, delicious.This time, although it was standing sushi, there were proper seats at the counter, so it felt like a regular sushi bar, and I tried a variety of dishes.The grilled options were great, and the simmered anago (sea eel) was outstanding.Next time, IÅfd like to visit on a weekday."
Delicious Tuna,"This was my second visit. Last time, I had to wait quite a bit on a regular Saturday, but this time I got in without waiting right before 1 PM on a weekday during Golden Week.I remembered the tuna's rich flavor from my previous visit, so I definitely ordered three pieces of Akami (red meat tuna). The overflowing shirasu (young sardines) gunkan was delicious, and the freshly grilled tamagoyaki (Japanese omelet) was so good that I ordered a second helping. Although I couldnÅft try many types of dishes, I was extremely satisfied.Personally, the cost performance isnÅft great since I drink draft beer, but I believe the satisfaction level would be high if you skip the drinks."
Revolving Sushi Supervised by a Renowned Restaurant!,"I visited the ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Honten"" located in Omotesando!It's about a 2-minute walk from Omotesando Station.This conveyor belt sushi restaurant is supervised by the Michelin-starred ""Ginza Onodera.""They wanted to make the quality cultivated in the renowned Ginza establishment easily accessible, which is why they created this conveyor belt sushi concept.*Note: Instead of a traditional conveyor belt, orders are placed via a touch panel.Due to its popularity, there's often a wait of about an hour on weekends.They use a ticket vending machine system to issue a waiting number.Enjoy authentic Edomae sushi made by skilled chefs, starting at around JPY 300 per plate.I tried a lot, but I highly recommend the tuna!They source their tuna from ""Yamako,"" a supplier used by premium sushi restaurants.I ordered red tuna, medium fatty tuna, and negitoro, and they were all delicious!I spent about JPY 5,000 after a decent amount of sushi, making it perfect for when you want to treat yourself!Åü Order Details- Medium Fatty Tuna (1 piece): JPY 620- Red Tuna (1 piece): JPY 420- Chuutoro Gunkan (2 pieces): JPY 620- Aurora Salmon (2 pieces): JPY 420- Overflowing Ikura Gunkan (2 pieces): JPY 930- Various Other ItemsÅü Self-IntroductionI explore various restaurants, focusing on noodles, izakaya, and yakiniku!I share my experiences on Instagram, so IÅfd be happy if you check it out!@gurume.kuro"

Delicious Chutoro,"This was my second visit, and when I arrived around 8 PM on a Wednesday, there was a wait for about 20 groups. Nevertheless, since I was alone, I was able to get in after about 30 minutes.I tried Yari Ika (longfin squid), Namashirasu (raw baby sardines), Akami (red tuna), Nakaochi (fatty tuna), Zuke (marinated fish), Chutoro (medium fatty tuna), Shio Miso Uni (saltwater sea urchin), Bafun Uni (bafun sea urchin), Aosa Soup (seaweed soup), and Tekka Maki (tuna roll).I definitely plan to order the Aosa Soup, Akami, and Chutoro next time I come."
"The charm of conveyor belt sushi, along with unique attractions not found elsewhere.","I have launched a gourmet site called Mitomi Emomono.Homepage: ""https://blog.33inc.jp/""Instagram: ""@mitomi_emon""Let me introduce one of the groups led by ""Sushi Ginza Onodera"", which has its main store in Ginza.This group operates both domestically and internationally, earning a Michelin star and gaining worldwide recognition. They also grabbed media attention by jointly auctioning tuna with Yamazaki at the New YearÅfs first auction. Their business has expanded to include tempura and charcoal-grilled dishes, transitioning them into a major restaurant group that draws attention both at home and abroad.Their new business model is conveyor belt sushi.In 2021, they opened ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" in Omotesando. While maintaining the casual and reasonable essence of conveyor belt sushi culture, they present top-quality ingredients that are surprising for a conveyor sushi restaurant. The casualization of sushi, which has become one of the high-end dishes, seems to be a trend, and the Onodera group has brilliantly succeeded in making it more casual, attracting many customers, particularly from abroad, to a fully booked restaurant on a daily basis.The highlight is undoubtedly the tuna from Yamazaki.Offering fatty tuna for over JPY 1000 is exceptional. The vinegared rice matches perfectly with the quality, clearly exceeding the typical conveyor belt sushi experience. The toro-taku roll using Yamazaki's tuna is a must-try.There are also unique menu items not typically found in Edo-mae sushi. I'm sure international guests and children will love them, too. As for me, Mitomi Emomono, I ended up selecting only the kinds of sushi that can be found solely at conveyor belt sushi, bringing back nostalgic memories. Haha.""Mackerel""""Kinmedai (Goldeneye Snapper)""""Salmon""""Ebi Mayo Gunkan""""Natto Gunkan""""Ikura Gunkan""""Onodera Special Chawanmushi""It was a great meal."
Non-Conveyor Sushi for Tourists,"ÅySushi Å¢ÅzThe tuna is relatively good. If you're going to eat it, I recommend the marinated tuna or medium fatty tuna. The salmon, however, lacks flavor and I do not recommend it. Overall, none of the ingredients were particularly delicious, and they didn't look very fresh either. Compared to this place, Nemuro Hanamaru is far superior among conveyor sushi options.ÅyValue for Money ÅzI had about 10 plates and it came to JPY 12,000. Considering the quality of the ingredients, I think thatÅfs quite expensive.ÅyWait Time ÅzI visited around 5:30 PM on a Sunday and there were about 40 groups waiting. The system was not functioning well, and I ended up waiting nearly two hours. They have a system where they call you when your number is near, but if you are not present when called, you could miss your turn and end up waiting much longer. Therefore, it's best not to wander far after check-in. It might be wiser to wait patiently in front of the restaurant.ÅyAtmosphere ÅõÅzThey hold events like a fish disassembly show, which could be entertaining for foreign tourists. They have touch-screen menus available in Chinese, Korean, and English, making it convenient for tourists. Additionally, all the staff were cheerful and very pleasant.ÅyInterior Å¢ÅzUnfortunately, the cleanliness of the restroom was a letdown, likely due to the high number of foreign tourists."
"Had high expectations, but...","Featured on TV, the Michelin-starred ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" is known for its reasonable prices and delicious flavors.I visited this restaurant with high expectations.You can place orders through a touchscreen panel, selecting whether to include wasabi and the size of the sushi rice.The chefs and staff work in teams, making service efficient.While the prices are on the higher side, the cost-performance ratio does not quite match the quality.The sushi toppings are larger compared to ordinary conveyor belt sushi, as expected.You can choose the size of the rice, but the regular size is just about right.It seems they use red vinegar for the rice.After the restaurant opened, there was a problem with hot water, so the tea was lukewarm.The staff were walking around with hot water, but I would have preferred a fresh refill instead of a top-up.They handle tuna from Yamako, and since I'm a fan of tuna, I ordered all tuna.The taste was not bad, but aside from the chu-toro and marinated tuna, the rest were a bit lacking. The chu-toro also seemed to lack sufficient fat.The bluefin tuna I had in Hokkaido was tastier.I also tried the recommended three pieces of sea bream, striped jack, and yellowtail, but they didn't impress me much.The marinated mackerel and kohada sushi were well-seasoned with vinegar, which I enjoyed.Many customers around me were ordering salmon, so I decided to try it too; it was slightly fatty but tasted average.The fin meat had good thickness and resilience but was somewhat lacking in fat.Inexpensive conveyor belt sushi often has surprisingly rich salmon and fin meat, so this might be seen as underwhelming.If you're looking for fat, the salmon belly might be a better choice.The miso soup was voluminous and worth the price, containing fish bones and a piece that resembled salmon fillet, providing a satisfying bite.I wish the flavor of the miso soup had been a bit stronger.Overall, it was better than average conveyor belt sushi, but I still felt the price didn't align with the quality."
Kaiten Sushi Version of Ginza Onodera!,"I visited the Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, which is always busy, located in Omotesando. I thought I'd be able to go without waiting around 9 PM on a Sunday night, but there were still two groups ahead of me. Fortunately, I was seated relatively quickly!This time, I opted for the standing sushi area. (Note: There are chairs available.)I ordered various items, mostly nigiri, using the touch panel system while browsing the menu. The tuna was particularly delicious, and the spring sea bream and toro-taku hand rolls were also outstanding!Since I went late at night, it seemed that popular items like sea urchin and kinmedai (red bream) were sold out... I definitely want to visit again during a time when I can get in without waiting! They also have takeout options available, so that might be a good choice too!"
Delicious,"What's included in the recommended set?A thrilling trio of sushi!This was my first time ordering it, and I got two sets with completely different pieces!Absolutely amazing!!!I'll definitely order this every time from now on!The bluefin tuna was fantastic!I also ordered grilled collar, but this time the fat felt a bit too rich."
You might not be able to get in right away when the restaurant opens.,"ÅyNotes, PointsÅzThere is a ticket machine at the entrance.You can get a point card by registering as a friend on LINE.Ordering is done via a tablet, and the sushi is not on a conveyor belt.ÅyMotivationÅzI decided to revisit because I had a good impression from my last visit.ÅyOrder, Visit Date SituationÅzDined in with three family members.Arrived at the entrance around 9:40 AM on a holiday Monday.I took a ticket and waited with four other groups.On this day, there were 23 groups waiting around 10:27 AM.I parked my car in a nearby street parking (JPY 300 for 60 minutes) and went to wait at the entrance around the opening time of 10:27 AM.The restaurant opened around 10:32 AM.I was guided inside according to my ticket number and seated.I placed my order through the tablet and settled the bill at the end.Payment was made using a credit card at the register near the entrance when leaving.ÅyImpressions, etc.ÅzI ordered more sushi than what is shown in the photos, and I did not drink any alcohol.The total bill for three family members was around JPY 25,000.The prices are on the higher side, but the sushi was quite delicious.The atmosphere felt somewhat like a restaurant aimed at tourists."
First Experience at Onodera,"This year, I couldn't go to the top tuna spots, but finally made my way to Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera for my first meal of the new year!One significant change is that you can now make online reservations and obtain a waiting number, which I wasn't aware of, so I just walked in. Additionally, the standing counter has been replaced with two tables for four guests.Note: The chefs are not in front of you, as the waitstaff will bring your orders.Date: WeekendTime: Around 11:15 AMWaiting Number: Approximately 55Wait Time: I was called around 12:45 PM.You have 60 minutes at the table, but since the dishes come out quickly, I think youÅfll find it more than sufficient.The tuna is indeed exquisite! They offer seasonal selections that may not be available next time, so if you see something you want, donÅft hesitate to order!For example, the scallops we had that day were smaller because they're not in season, but they were stacked two together. However, they actually seemed larger than usual."
"A delightful sushi restaurant with long lines, offering not only great flavors but also satisfying entertainment.","I visited Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, a popular conveyor belt sushi restaurant in Omotesando. The chefs were lively and full of excitement, making the experience enjoyable. Communicating with the chefs is truly one of the highlights of dining at a sushi restaurant.Of course, the sushi itself was delicious.The chefÅfs recommendation for the day was, ""We might just add caviar!"" When I ordered it, I was thrilled to find caviar on top of the squid!It was genuinely a fun sushi restaurant. It was a great meal!"
Charming Kaiten Sushi in Omotesando,"This sushi restaurant in Omotesando always has a waiting list of dozens of groups. On this occasion, we were lucky enough to secure a counter seat for two just after 11 AM. The interior is beautifully decorated and has a luxurious feel, although the conveyor belt is there, it isn't actually in operation. All orders are placed through a touch panel. The menu offers a variety of options ranging from over JPY 1000 for a single piece to around JPY 300 for two pieces. However, being here, we couldn't resist choosing some of the more expensive and delicious-looking options. The medium fatty tuna simply melts in your mouth, and every piece we tried was fresh, even the nori on the sushi was delightful. Both the drinks and sushi complemented each other perfectly, making for a highly satisfying lunch. Even though my companion doesn't drink alcohol, our total came to just over JPY 10,000 for two. ItÅfs a bit pricey, but as we settled the bill, I noticed that there were already more than ten groups waiting, which speaks volumes about the restaurant's popularity."
Entertainment was also included,"I got a numbered ticket online and strolled around Omotesando, waiting about 30 minutes for my turn to enter.The ordering method was similar to the recent trend of ordering via tablet at sushi restaurants, but seeing the chefs preparing and rolling the sushi right in front of me truly felt like the essence of a sushi shop.Everything I tried was incredibly delicious, but the Engawa (flounder belly) especially stood out.During my visit, there was a fun quiz to guess the weight of a large grouper, and I won a free grouper nigiri for getting close to the answer.The restaurant was lively, always filled with customers, which clearly explained its popularity. I definitely want to visit again."
Casual even for solo diners.,"Dinner for one in Omotesando.This place came to mind.It seemed to attract many overseas tourists.I was told there would be a 60-70 minute wait, but since I was dining alone, I was called in just 10 minutes.This was a pleasant surprise.You can feel the passion behind every menu item, especially their strong emphasis on shrimp.I indulged a bit, so it was on the pricier side, but for delicious sushi that's not excessively expensive, this is a great spot.I discovered a fantastic restaurant for solo dinners."
Tokyo's No.1 Kaiten Sushi!!,"I visited on a Saturday around 11:30 AM.There was a wait for 20 groups.I took a ticket and spent time in Omotesando, arriving back around 12:30 PM.As they focus on tuna, I enjoyed the medium fatty tuna, nakaochi (tuna belly), and lean tuna.The cuts were satisfying and thick for the price, but it would be even better if they could enhance the natural flavor of the tunaperhaps it's due to the thawing method?I was very satisfied with the ikura (salmon roe) and squid.The Aori Ika, in particular, was thick and sweetjust fantastic.The desserts were all delicious too!I love conveyor belt sushi and have frequented places like Nemuro Hanamaru, Toriyon, and Maimon Sushi,but I highly recommend this place in Tokyo.I can't wait to try their shellfish next time!"
Casual Lunch Stop,"After my health check-up, I was craving sushi, so I decided to visit this place.I initially intended to go to the rotating sushi section, but I mistakenly checked in at the counter instead. In the end, it turned out to be a great decision as it was quiet, and I was able to observe the chefs preparing sushi.The touchscreen ordering system made it easy, and the cleanliness and delicious sushi really made my experience top-notch!Every piece of sushi was delicious, but I felt that the selection was a bit limited.Personally, I would have loved to see a wider variety of shellfish."
Family's Favorite Kaiten Sushi,"For Valentine's Day, I was taken out to this restaurant. Since it was a holiday, it was even busier than usual.We ordered:- Cold Yellowtail- Medium Fatty Tuna from Yamakou- Salmon Roe- Cod Milt Gunkan- Grilled Salmon with Saikyo Miso- Grilled Fluke with Saikyo Miso- Boiled Snow Crab- Seafood Chawanmushi- Shoyu Ramen- Fried Chicken- French Fries- Overflowing Shirasu Gunkan- Udon- Dashimaki TamagoThe service was fast, and not only were the nigiri excellent, but the quality of the side dishes was also high, making it a favorite for everyone!"
To be honest...,"ÅüOn TasteThis restaurant promotes itself with the name 'Onodera', but I believe there are only a few sushi toppings that are actually served here. If you enter expecting the authentic Onodera experience based solely on the name, you might feel a bit let down (laughs). While the sushi is tasty, there's nothing that truly amazes you. Aside from those items labeled 'Onodera's...', I suspect that many of the ingredients might be sourced separately for the Omotesando location rather than being related to Ginza Onodera.Some pieces are hard to bite through, and the taste resembles that of a 100 yen sushi? level in many cases.ÅüOn ServiceThe service speed is quite fast, comparable to standard conveyor belt sushi. When I visited around 6 PM, I had to wait about 40 minutes. The online reservation system is quite convenient!"
Famous Sushi Restaurant's Kaiten Sushi Version,"I heard that a famous sushi restaurant offers affordable yet delicious kaiten sushi, so I decided to visit Onodera in Omotesando.I made a reservation through e-park the day before and enjoyed shopping in Omotesando until it was time for my reservation.I had to wait about 30 minutes after my arrival, but I was finally seated.It happened to be Setsubun, so we enjoyed some futomaki and participated in a fish weight guessing quiz, which added some fun to the experience.Of course, the taste was absolutely satisfying.The fish was fresh, thick, and indulgent, while the rice had a mild sourness that melted in my mouth.While I was prepared to wait in line, I definitely want to come back again."
Delicious options beyond just tuna.,"I visited again for lunch.I made a reservation online and entered the restaurant around 11:30 on a weekday.It was a bit disappointing that the crab tower was not available,but the tuna was consistently delicious, and I was satisfied.Next time, I think I will try the neighboring standing sushi bar, Onodera (though there are seats available)."
Casual Sushi in Omotesando,"I visited this restaurant with a friend on a holiday afternoon. Although itÅfs named Kaiten Sushi, the sushi isnÅft actually revolving. Each table is equipped with a touchscreen for placing orders. We arrived just before the lunch rush and witnessed about 10 groups waiting. We braced ourselves for a long wait, but the turnover was quick, and we were seated in about 20 minutes. The sushi was thick, fresh, and incredibly delicious! While the prices are reasonable, I left very satisfied. I enjoyed casual yet high-quality sushi."
The sushi here is outstanding,"ItÅfs been a while since my last visit!I returned to Onodera near Omotesando Station.I ordered the following dishes:- Medium fatty tuna (Chutoro)- Seared fatty tuna (Aburi)- Nakaochi (tuna scraps)- Sea urchin (Uni)- Squid (Ika)- Salmon- Tekka Maki (Tuna Roll)- Broiled eel (Anago)ItÅfs still busy as usual, but itÅfs definitely worth the wait!"
Luxury Kaiten Sushi in Omotesando,"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera is located a short walk down a side street from Omotesando. While the price per plate is a bit high, you can enjoy high-quality sushi that justifies it. This restaurant is highly recommended for those who find it difficult to enter traditional sushi shops, as it offers a more approachable atmosphere!"

High-end Kaiten Sushi in Ginza,"This place is about a 3-minute walk from Omotesando Station. This was my third visit. I checked in at the touch panel around 5:50 PM and received a numbered ticket. About 40 minutes later, I was called in to dine. The sushi prices range from around JPY 300 to about JPY 2500. They also have a variety of side dishes, including simmered options. Each piece of sushi is large and satisfying. ItÅfs enjoyable for both kids and adults. I will be coming back soon."

A casual spot to enjoy Yamako's tuna!,"I had been curious about Onodera's Kaiten Sushi! Here, you can enjoy authentic tuna from Yamako casually, so I ordered a variety centered around tuna.  I tried the medium fatty tuna, marinated red meat, tuna and sea urchin gunkan, and the tuna and green onion roll, and the quality of Yamako's tuna was truly delicious. ^^At Onodera, you typically get a set course, but this place is great if you just want to enjoy some tuna quickly!"
The pinnacle of conveyor belt sushi. Tonight's soul restoration at Aoyama's Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera.,"After a tough day at work, I needed some comfort from the city lights, so I visited the Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, known for its top-quality tuna from the first auction at Toyosu Market this year. This restaurant is perhaps one of the best revolving sushi spots out there. I thought about my budget but realized that hesitation would lead to regret, so I'm treating myself to a solo dinner tonight.Looking around the counter, I was the only solo diner; everyone else was quite stylish. ThatÅfs the vibe in Aoyama. However, the chefs behind the counter carried on with their work, paying no mind to the romantic interactions of the customers, showcasing their professionalism.All the tuna dishes are served on gold plates, which reflects how much the restaurant values its tuna.Åú Engawa (Flounder Fin) - 2 pieces 440My favorite! They are rich and flavorful. Delicious.Åú Aburi (Seared) - 3 pieces 980Engawa, scallop, and what was the middle one? I should have thought about it before eating. The engawa slightly overshadowed the taste, but thatÅfs okay since itÅfs one of my favorites.Åú Hirame (Flounder) - 2 pieces 620I like to start with the white fish.Åú Yamazaki Hon Maguro (Bluefin Tuna Lean) - 1 piece 420It was like rare beef tenderloin. So much more delicious.Åú Kanburi (Winter Yellowtail) - 2 pieces 700ItÅfs the season for this fish, so I had to try it. Would regret it if I didn't.Åú Hand-Made Ikura (Salmon Roe) in Soy Sauce - 700A gem-like ikura in one bite. The allergen information is very considerate.Åú Aburi Toro - 1 piece 830As I age, I find some toro too fatty, but searing it makes it perfect. I switched from beer to sake here.Åú Homemade Kohada (Gizzard Shad) - 1 piece 340Is this Edo-mae style? Let's have a piece of a shiny fish. Feeling good about this.Åú Yamazaki Hon Maguro Nakaochi (Bluefin Tuna Fatty Scrap) - 2 pieces 720Even if it's nakaochi, it's high-quality fatty tuna, much better than ordinary tuna.Åú Live Botan Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) with Fried Head - 950The fried head is a delightful touch! Perfect with sake. The freshly peeled meat is of course deliciousextremely fresh.Åú Yamazaki Hon Maguro Chutoro (Bluefin Tuna Medium Fat) - 1 piece 620The big finale with the chutoro. No complaints here.Wow, I completely overindulged without considering my budget. I guess I'll be living off calorie mates starting tomorrow. But tonight, it was all worth it. My heart was mended. Thank you, Onodera, for the heartfelt restoration. It was a wonderful meal. It was great!"
Better than usual Kaiten Sushi,"The system requires you to go before the opening and get a numbered ticket. When I found the ticket, it indicated a wait time of 40-50 minutes, but that wasn't the case; I was seated right away (I was around the 13th in line).You can order your favorites through a touchscreen, and they serve you the sushi directly without needing to take anything from the rotating conveyor belt. (I wondered if they were considering past incidents that happened in conveyor belt sushi restaurants.)I also visited the standing sushi spot, Onodera, but I felt more satisfaction there personally. The cost for three of us was just under JPY 15,000. I think it's a place that's easy for international guests to enjoy."

I have visited their main store in Ginza and the Futako Tamagawa branch, and I have wonderful memories of those visits. So when I learned that they have a Kaiten Sushi version in Omotesando, I had to go! Although I couldn't make a reservation ahead of time, I found out that I could register for a waiting list through EPARK. While at home, I registered for a spot and quickly headed to the restaurant. When I arrived just before opening, there were 15 groups waiting. After successfully being seated just after 11:30! The interior exudes luxury and vibrancy. Even though it's a kaiten sushi, the sushi isn't rotating, and you place your order using a touch panel. Honestly, the quality is unbelievable for a kaiten sushi. The red vinegar rice has a nice gentle warmth, melting perfectly and matching the toppings exquisitely. And the portion sizes of each topping are large and incredibly fresh! I particularly loved the Yamakou Hon Maguro Chutoro and the simmered Anago. It's no surprisetheir top-quality tuna was auctioned off at the first sale of the season. The moment it enters my mouth, it melts perfectly, delivering an incredible taste. The crab miso gunkan is also generously rich. The seasonal Kanburi is a must-try. I appreciate being able to choose the amount of rice as well. During peak times, thereÅfs a one-hour seating limit, but I was satisfied with the deliciousness in such a short time! It's truly incredible to enjoy authentic and exquisite sushi from Onodera at this price. By around 12:30 when I left, there were 60 groups waitingno wonder it's so popular! The location is also excellent, just a short walk from Omotesando Station. IÅfd love to visit again using the EPARK waiting system. By the way, I heard a branch has also opened in Kyoto. When I crave Onodera sushi back in Kansai, IÅfll head over to Kyoto. It was a great meal!"
Disappointing,"The reasons are as follows:1. Long wait times. Although EPRAK is introduced, which allows for waiting away from the counter, you still feel the pressure to return.2. Prices. They are relatively high, priced at the level where you could dine at a much higher-end sushi restaurant for the same amount.3. The taste is not that impressive. Overall, the seasoning is too strong, and the quality of the ingredients is somewhat lower than expected, given the prices.If you were to remove 'Kaiten Sushi' from the name and eliminate the conveyor belt, and either lower the prices or improve the chefs' training, while putting the long wait times on hold, it might lead to better ratings."
Perfect for an hour,"HolidayI made a reservation at 10:30 AM via EPARK (25 groups waiting).I was not present when called at 10:40 AM.I arrived at 11:05 AM (4 groups waiting upon return).I was seated at 11:40 AM.Since there's a one-hour limit, the first round had to leave all at once around 11:35 AM.YamakouÅfs authentic bluefin tuna and medium fatty tuna are reliably delicious.I was personally amazed by the richness of the grilled engawa.And, when it comes to Onodera, the simmered anago (conger eel) and toro-taku hand rolls are must-tries.The soup with fish scraps (ara-jiru) is quite hearty.For someone like me who struggles with conversations in non-conveyor sushi restaurants, this place offers the chance to enjoy authentic sushi in just one hour.The cost performance is relatively good at this great establishment."
Affordable Kaiten Sushi Worth the Wait,"Last time it was still quite warm, so I was eager to visit during the colder season. I went around 2 PM on a holiday and had to wait for about an hour. It's nice that there are many shops around, so you can shop while waiting. Once again, I was very satisfied with how much I ate.I believe this place is perfect for when you want to enjoy better sushi than what chain conveyor-belt sushi offers, but you find counter sushi to be too formal and expensive."

Delicious,"What's included in the recommended set?A thrilling trio of sushi!This was my first time ordering it, and I got two sets with completely different pieces!Absolutely amazing!!!I'll definitely order this every time from now on!The bluefin tuna was fantastic!I also ordered grilled collar, but this time the fat felt a bit too rich."
"Onodera!! A luxurious experience dining at the counter, not at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant!","Today, I finally visited a restaurant that had been on my mind for a while!Since I can't go to the main Onodera location, I went to the Omotesando branch.It's incredibly busy here as well.I took a number for both the conveyor sushi and the sashimi, hoping to be seated with the quicker option, but either way, it's a one-hour wait.There are hardly any Japanese customers around it's just like when I visited Noda-Iwa before!There are many people who give up and leave because of the crowd, but after about 45 minutes, I was finally able to get in.Even though I chose the sashimi option, it's a counter sushi experience, with the only difference being that orders are made through a tablet.The distinction between conveyor sushi and counter sushi is that the counter serves the same rice and fish as the main branch.They also take the time to prepare the fish with aging and decorative cuts.In contrast, conveyor sushi has different rice and preparation methods.Of course, the prices are about 10% to 20% higher than conveyor sushi, but personally, I really want to enjoy something delicious like this.No alcohol today.I ordered everything as individual pieces.The most expensive item is the sea urchin at JPY 1300, while most others range from JPY 700 to JPY 800.Åö Two pieces of Kawa Hagi liverÅö ScallopÅö Salmon roeÅö Medium fatty tunaÅö AbaloneÅö White shrimp with kombuÅö Spring sea breamÅö Cod roe nigiriÅö Two pieces of bafun uniÅö Cod milt tempuraÅö Steamed egg custard with snow crab and salmon roeThe fish was thick, and the rice was red vinegared, which was also delicious. On this day, the chef was youthful and fun, creating a great atmosphere as all the counter seats were occupied by Japanese customers who were happily chatting with each other.This is definitely a place I want to come back to, even if it means waiting in line.Of course, I want to sit at the counter!"
Family's Favorite Kaiten Sushi,"For Valentine's Day, I was taken out to this restaurant. Since it was a holiday, it was even busier than usual.We ordered:- Cold Yellowtail- Medium Fatty Tuna from Yamakou- Salmon Roe- Cod Milt Gunkan- Grilled Salmon with Saikyo Miso- Grilled Fluke with Saikyo Miso- Boiled Snow Crab- Seafood Chawanmushi- Shoyu Ramen- Fried Chicken- French Fries- Overflowing Shirasu Gunkan- Udon- Dashimaki TamagoThe service was fast, and not only were the nigiri excellent, but the quality of the side dishes was also high, making it a favorite for everyone!"
Highly satisfying Kaiten Sushi with great cost performance,"This is no ordinary kaiten sushi!ItÅfs called kaiten sushi, but it doesnÅft actually rotate!Perhaps itÅfs a new genre because the kanji doesnÅft say Åekaiten sushi.ÅfItÅfs far better than any weird sushi place!Not only is the quality high, but the freshness of the ingredients is remarkableit's completely on par with a skilled chef's sushi.And itÅfs affordable! To enjoy this level of quality and leave feeling quite full for just JPY 5000 is unbeatable! If this place were near my house, I would go even alone!"
Affordable Sushi in the City Center,"At first glance, it looks like an ordinary kaiten sushi place surrounded by the kitchen. But the taste is delightful! I visited around 2:00 PM on a weekday and only had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated. After enjoying as much chutoro, akami, uni, and other favorites as I wanted, my bill came to around JPY 5,000. The service was quick, making it a great spot for a casual yet tasty meal."
Affordable High-End Edomae Sushi,"I visited this high-end kaiten sushi restaurant in Ginza, which has even received a Michelin star.Since I went during the peak of lunchtime on a weekday, there were only about three groups waiting. I was seated in about five minutes.The concept of the restaurant is to provide a place where you can enjoy Ginza's exquisite flavors anytime without the high barriers typically associated with it. They offer a lineup comparable to traditional Ginza establishments, featuring red vinegar sushi rice and using top-quality tuna from Yamakou, all at reasonable prices.At certain times, there are announcements in the restaurant, allowing diners to enjoy freshly prepared sushi right on the spot; I got to try some flounder today. It seems they also have a tuna-cutting demonstration occasionally.The sweet shrimp are served with crispy fried heads, making it possible to enjoy the flavor all the way to the roe.The fish soup is generously filled with large cuts of fish, providing a rich, flavorful broth that's quite delicious.I expect weekends to be quite busy. Since they utilize EPARK for managing wait times, I recommend checking EPARK in advance and making an online reservation if possible.It was a great meal."
Delicious options beyond just tuna.,"I visited again for lunch.I made a reservation online and entered the restaurant around 11:30 on a weekday.It was a bit disappointing that the crab tower was not available,but the tuna was consistently delicious, and I was satisfied.Next time, I think I will try the neighboring standing sushi bar, Onodera (though there are seats available)."

Delicious Chutoro,"This was my second visit, and when I arrived around 8 PM on a Wednesday, there was a wait for about 20 groups. Nevertheless, since I was alone, I was able to get in after about 30 minutes.I tried Yari Ika (longfin squid), Namashirasu (raw baby sardines), Akami (red tuna), Nakaochi (fatty tuna), Zuke (marinated fish), Chutoro (medium fatty tuna), Shio Miso Uni (saltwater sea urchin), Bafun Uni (bafun sea urchin), Aosa Soup (seaweed soup), and Tekka Maki (tuna roll).I definitely plan to order the Aosa Soup, Akami, and Chutoro next time I come."
Kaiten Sushi Onodera: A Hit Among Foreigners,"Today's lunch was at 3:45 PM.While most restaurants are closed for lunch during this time, this place is a rare gem that welcomes guests anytime.As expected, it was bustling during lunch hours, but luckily I was able to find a seat without much wait.This kaiten sushi spot utilizes touch screens for ordering.The sushi here tastes slightly better than at other conveyor belt sushi restaurants.Most of the customers inside were foreigners, and everyone was smiling and enjoying their meals.Thank you very much.It was a great meal."

Even though it's a conveyor belt sushi place, the sushi isn't rotating; you place orders via a touch panel. You can choose the amount of rice and whether or not to include wasabi. The tuna is delicious, of course, but everything is superb. I could eat it forever, especially the way Otoro melts in your mouth! The Hokkaido-produced Botan shrimp was freshly prepared right in front of me, and it's incredibly sweetit's on another level! And the crab miso? ItÅfs the real deal; you can taste the authentic flavor. Combining it with crab meat made it exceptionally delicious. However, the highlight was the abalone. Again, freshly prepared. It's quite thick and has a wonderful chewy texturewhat is this?! Ah, so tasty! I finished with the last piece being the abalone. It was a great meal!"
Enjoy high-quality Edomae sushi at a great price! ,"Located in Omotesando, Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera offers a reasonable and casual sushi experience in a conveyor belt format.Since reservations are not possible, you can take a numbered ticket from the machine at the entrance and wait.The restaurant features both a conveyor belt sushi section and a standing sushi area.In the conveyor belt sushi area, each person orders using a touch panel. There are counter seats as well as box seats.On a weekday around 12:30 PM, I was able to enter without any wait.I had my sights set on the renowned Yamazaki honmaguro (bluefin tuna), and both the fatty tuna and marinated red meat were astonishingly delicious. The fatty tuna was excellent, but the marinated red meat was the best IÅfve ever tasted. The salt-seared engawa (flounder fin) and live octopus were also exceptional.The shoyu ramen had a strong soy sauce flavor, which at times overshadowed the sushi when eaten together. However, the ramen itself was delicious, so I recommend ordering it as a finishing dish.At around JPY 4,000 per person, I think itÅfs a great deal to enjoy the flavors of Onodera.Ordered ItemsÅõ Yamazaki honmaguro fatty tunaÅõ 2 pieces of live octopus from HokkaidoÅõ 2 pieces of salt-seared engawaÅõ 1 piece of marinated Yamazaki honmaguro red meatÅõ 2 pieces of winter yellowtailÅõ 2 pieces of fresh salmonÅõ 2 pieces of live skipjack tunaÅõ 2 pieces of Ishigaki sea breamÅõ 1 cucumber rollÅõ Fried octopusÅõ Homemade Onodera chawanmushi (egg custard)Åõ Aosa seaweed soup from Ise ShimaÅõ Tanrei shoyu ramenNovember 2023"
Enjoying the Fun of Choosing Sushi Before the Jingu Gaien Illumination,"After buying some of my favorite bread, I had dinner before heading to Jingu Gaien.This was my first choice, and I had planned to look for somewhere else if there was a long line, but when I arrived, I was able to enter without delay. (No line)ItÅfs been a while since I visited a Kaiten sushi restaurant, but I love sushi and go nearly once a month.This restaurant only offers an omakase course, so I had always wished for a place where I could order what I wanted. As a child, I dreamed of ordering pieces from the display, not based on a set menu.As I grew up, I learned to appreciate delicious food and noticed that such places have become less common. And now, ordering sushi is mostly done at kaiten sushi which is the most accessible option for me.Knowing about the opening of this restaurant, I wished to visit, and my dream has finally come true.I sat at a large counter (there seemed to be table seating as well) and used a touch panel to order.My husband and I each ordered our favorites, and we tried one of each two-piece item:- Kawa-hagi liver- Yamazaki Toro- Shira-iko ponzu- Ara soup- Aosa soup- Horse mackerel- Overflowing ikura- Abalone- Shime-saba- Snow crab- Botan shrimp- Mizu-ika (squid)- Boiled amaebi- Ankimo gunkan- Toro-taku- Bafun uni- ScallopWhile the quality of the toppings was decent, the sushi rice wasnÅft particularly tasty and lacked texture.It wasnÅft extraordinarily delicious sushi, but I was satisfied with the joy of ordering what I like.From there, I headed straight to the illumination at Jingu Gaien. The ginkgo tree-lined street, which I saw for the first time, was simply breathtaking."

A Must-Visit Kaiten Sushi Destination,"It was my first visit in a while. I truly appreciate the ability to wait for my turn using the app. Upon returning, I noticed there are many foreign tourists; it seems to have become a popular sightseeing spot. The prices, flavors, and atmosphere seem to have changed since my last visit, possibly due to the increase in tourists. I didn't feel as impressed as I did before."
Delicious Sushi in a Flash!,"I entered around 4:00 PM, and the restaurant was almost fully booked.I tried the chutoro from Yamako, shirako, winter yellowtail, and horse mackerel, and they were all incredibly delicious.Personally, I really liked the sushi rice.I ordered 7 dishes for about JPY 4,000.I was satisfied to enjoy a little bit of everything delicious."

Support by Eating! Seafood Campaign,"Wednesday around 4 PMI had been curious about this sushi restaurant for a while. I checked their website on e-park and confirmed that there was no wait!

(I didnÅft see any posters for the ""Seafood Campaign,"" so I asked the staff if it was available. They said it wasn't. However, I decided to try paying with PayPay just in case, and I was indeed rewarded!)"
I've been curious about it since I saw it on TV.,"The kaiten sushi at this upscale sushi restaurant in Ginza greatly exceeded my expectations!The lively atmosphere is filled with cheerful banter, and the place is beautifully decorated. There are both standing and counter dining options, but since we wanted to enjoy our meal leisurely, we chose the counter.Even though itÅfs kaiten sushi, the prices arenÅft as casual as those at chains like ??? or ???, so we took our time to look through the menu, mentally calculating while narrowing down our choices for what we really wanted to order.We started with crab soup. It was delicious! Just as I had hoped.We began with the sushi, starting with mackerel.The seasoning wasnÅft too strong, which I liked.The way it was cut seemed different from other places, which was interesting to notice.The nakaochi was indulgently topped with chunks of tuna, making it very rich in flavor.When we ordered the natto maki with toppings, it came with a very stylish presentation of plum, bonito flakes, and green onions.You can really tell the attention to detail here!We also ordered the number one favorite: medium fatty tuna (chu-toro).Mmm~~ The fat was perfectly balanced, rich, and delicious. I wanted more! We also ordered fried octopus and chawanmushi.The fried octopus had a strong flavor, but it was chewy and delicious.The chawanmushi was luxurious, containing crab, ginkgo nuts, shiitake mushrooms, and salmon roe. It was simply gorgeous! ItÅfs something I could eat every day! We stopped when we were about 80% full, and together with my husband, our bill came to around JPY 7000.I was very satisfied!"
A sushi restaurant worth the wait,"A great spot to enjoy affordable sushi from Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera.Due to its location in Omotesando, the wait time was about 1 hour and 30 minutes.The queue system works by entering your phone number, and you receive a call when your turn is approaching, allowing you to stroll around Harajuku until itÅfs time.The restaurant has an element of entertainment, offering special items like toro hand rolls during certain times, making the experience enjoyable.Every sushi dish was delicious.Although it is labeled as a conveyor sushi restaurant, the sushi does not rotate; the chefs prepare each piece to order.The wait time is long, but I believe this place is well worth a visit."
High-Quality Kaiten Sushi with Yamako's Tuna,"This is the highest quality among conveyor sushi. You can also enjoy tuna from Yamakou. I visited around 1 PM on a weekday, and I was lucky to get in without waiting. By 2 PM, there were about two groups in line. The taste was excellent, the service was great, and the presentation was impressive, so it's no surprise that there's often a line."
A taste of Onodera from abroad,"OmotesandoOn a Friday night, I had trouble finding a reservation, so I wandered around Omotesando, but I found this place where I could get a table if I waited! It was a walk-in.The interior is spacious, and the turnover is quick, so I didnÅft have to wait long. There were many international guests, and I didn't hear much Japanese.I usually enjoy eating mackerel and horse mackerel, but unfortunately, many items were sold out at night, so I ended up ordering tuna and medium fatty tuna repeatedly.Although itÅfs on the pricier side for conveyer sushi, it is definitely delicious! "
Inconsistent Quality of IngredientsÅyOtto Selection at TV 2/2Åz,"ÅsVisited in October 2023ÅtAfter enjoying ""I'm donut?"" in Omotesando, we headed here.Arriving at 10:45 on a weekday, there was no one waiting! If it gets crowded, they mentioned a 90-minute limit.I learned about this place from my partner, who was drawn by the enthusiastic food review by Shingo Yanagisawa on TV AsahiÅfs ""Gyo-tenÅôSennyu Tours!""(You can find detailed store names and concepts here)At ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,"" you can enjoy the same quality as the high-end sushi restaurant ""Sushi Ginza Onodera Sohonten"" at a reasonable price. The main kitchen near the flagship store also prepares sushi for the conveyor belt. While the flagship store offers ""homemade kohada"" for JPY 1100 per piece, here it is available for only JPY 340. The secret to the low prices is sourcing high-quality large fish at a reduced cost due to less demand. They acquire the fish just before the Toyosu Market closes. ""Scallops with shells"" are JPY 1100 at the flagship store but only JPY 720 here. Onodera uses carefully selected tuna from ""Yamakou,"" a premium tuna wholesale supplier.Prices are as follows: ""Chutoro"" at JPY 2200 at the flagship, JPY 620 here; ""Akami"" at JPY 1100 at the flagship, JPY 420 here; and ""Otoro"" at JPY 3300 at the flagship, JPY 930 here.With thorough preparation, my expectations were high.The interior sparkles in a way that feels far from a typical sushi restaurant, with three four-person tables and about 32 counter seats? While there weren't any sushi on the conveyor, they do have a tap for tea, so pouring tea over it is quite nice. The chef announced, ""Today we have a special abalone!"" with a microphone performance!This prompted spontaneous applause from the customers!Then the chef continues, ""Limited quantities of abalone, please order quickly!""Orders started coming in one after another.""This is the person removing the shells!"" they said as the atmosphere filled with excitement.Soon the sound of a bell similar to those used in year-end lottery events rang.""Now, something exciting is about to happen!""Naturally, we couldnÅft resist ordering the abalone.As for the rest of our orders...Åú Shime-saba (2 pieces) JPY 440 Only my partner tried it.

Reflections on the train ride back. Wooko: ""There was some inconsistency with the toppings. Personally, the best sushi I've had so far in terms of flavor and cost performance was probably at 'Ginza Sushi Mitomi.'""My partner: ""Well, they donÅft serve anything other than sushi there, and itÅfs quiet, so it feels hard to order.

Delicious Kaiten Sushi Every Time,"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in OmotesandoI went shopping in Omotesando for the first time in a while and heard there was a kaiten sushi (conveyor belt sushi) from the luxury sushi restaurant ""Ginza Onodera,"" so I decided to check it out.To my surprise, the quality was outstanding, featuring delicious cuts like medium-fatty tuna and fresh mackerel that you wouldnÅft expect from a kaiten sushi place! (Åù_Åù;)There was even a tuna filleting demonstration during my visit.This is definitely one of the places I want to return to."
I had higher expectations...,"Otoro 2Chutoro 3Akami 4Kohada 3Shime Saba 4  beautifully fatty and delicious.Nishin 3Engawa 2Madai 3Salmon 3Nakaochi Gunkan 3Engawa Aburi 4Service 2There were inconsistencies in the timing from order to delivery, and it almost led to a mix-up with the order next to me, resulting in a less than favorable impression."
Delicious Conveyor Belt Sushi!,"Kaiten Sushi Onodera!It's a great place to quickly eat delicious food when you're short on time!It's amazing that they offer Yamako's tuna despite being a conveyor-belt sushi restaurant!Every ingredient, from the fish to the rice, is on a different level compared to other conveyor-belt sushi places.I'm truly happy to be able to enjoy such delicious sushi here!I will definitely come back! It was a great meal!"
Sushi that even Tetsuko enjoyed,"We thought we should try the sushi that Ms. Tetsuko had on her show, so we made a reservation. The online booking system was smooth and convenient. I was so hungry that I ended up eating a lot and forgot to take photos. The medium-fat tuna, anago (grilled eel), and natto rolls were delicious. The natto rolls, in particular, took the top spot in my personal ranking! The high-quality seaweed wrapped lightly around the filling combined with the seasonings was irresistible. Just JPY 230what a great deal! It might be better to share a plate for two, but since the price is higher for just one piece, the cost performance isnÅft the best. Next time, IÅfll try either a budget-friendly conveyor belt sushi or a non-conveyor sushi restaurant."
A Sushi Restaurant Not Worth the Trip,"I went here just to accompany a friend, but everything was overpriced and not particularly tasty. It might appeal to inbound tourists, but if you can justify the location fee, it could be worth a visit. As for me, I probably won't come back. I think I'd find much more satisfaction at Kura Sushi."
"Highest price for Kaiten Sushi, but very satisfying","Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera offers a unique take on conveyor belt sushi. Although the sourcing is the same, the menu likely differs, featuring some interesting items. For instance, it's unlikely you would find fresh herring or small corvina at the Ginza location.They use tuna from Toyosu's Yamako, and the Onodera group has recently been the top bidder for the first tuna auction on New Year's Day.On this day, they had a tuna dismantling show, and it was amazing to hear that over 200 kg of tuna from Oma arrived in September. I tried the fatty tuna for JPY 980, and it was truly exceptionaldefinitely not the level of tuna you'd expect at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant.I ordered the clear soup, and it was generously filled with salmon trimmings! At just JPY 520, it felt like a great deal.While the standard serving is two pieces, there are also options for single pieces, so keep an eye out for that.The rice was red rice, but it didn't feel significantly different from what I had at a standing sushi bar previously, leading me to think they might not be focused on temperature. However, the generous portions were great, and my overseas friends were delighted, so I definitely plan to return."
Premium Ingredient Kaiten Sushi,"This kaiten sushi restaurant uses high-quality ingredients. Unlike typical conveyor belt sushi places, here you order each plate individually via a touch panel. While some reviews mention poor cost-performance, enjoying high-end ingredients like red vinegar sushi at this price is usually impossible. The restaurant operates on a larger scale with fewer chefs than usual, allowing them to offer excellent ingredients at a reasonable cost. The tuna comes from the renowned Yamako, and on the day of my visit, there was a demo of tuna filleting by Yamako. The showcase featured a giant over 300 kg Hon-maguro (bluefin tuna) from Oma. I initially thought it was more about the show, but taking the opportunity, I savored my sushi while watching. Seeing the impressive size of the giant hon-maguro is definitely worth it. I also had the fatty tuna, which was quite good, though it tastes better when properly chilled. In terms of flavor, the Hon-maguro was exceptional. You won't find this quality at other kaiten sushi places."
Danchi Sushi Restaurant,"It's not a typical kaiten sushi place. Although it doesn't revolve, the taste is truly fantastic.Every aspect is crafted with precisionit's high quality without being excessively luxurious, and the atmosphere is lively, which is genuinely impressive.Although you can't make reservations, I found that they were using epark once I got inside.The anago (grilled eel) is simply extraordinary... it's so tender that you can actually feel the texture of the rice, which is hard to comprehend.Pure bliss."
Affordable Kaiten Sushi Worth the Wait,"Last time it was still quite warm, so I was eager to visit during the colder season. I went around 2 PM on a holiday and had to wait for about an hour. It's nice that there are many shops around, so you can shop while waiting. Once again, I was very satisfied with how much I ate.I believe this place is perfect for when you want to enjoy better sushi than what chain conveyor-belt sushi offers, but you find counter sushi to be too formal and expensive."
Incredibly Delicious Kaiten Sushi at Onodera!,"On my way back from Tochigi, I had a bit of time in Tokyo and decided to have lunch at Onodera. The last time I visited, it was extremely busy, and I had to take a ticket from the machine to secure a table, waiting quite a while before being seated.This time, I was prepared for a long wait, but surprisingly, due to it being a weekday at 1:30 PM, I was able to get in quite easily. It seems like many of the customers were tourists. The atmosphere inside was incredibly lively, and it felt like a bustling sushi restaurant. They also have a great selection of wine, so I decided to enjoy it alongside the delicious sushi.The price per plate ranges from JPY 600 to the low JPY 1000s. Every sushi piece was so delicious that I could easily keep eating. Among the dishes I had this time, I found the akagai (red clam) to be quite a bargain. As for the side dish, the fish bones and leftover parts soup was rich in flavor and very tasty.While enjoying my lunch at Onodera, a sudden torrential rain and thunderstorm caught me off guard. At that moment, I didn't foresee the big trouble that was about to come, and I was just taking it easy, but thatÅfs when a series of unfortunate events began.All in all, the sushi here is incredibly delicious, making it one of my favorite sushi spots!"
No Soy Sauce Needed: A Casual Spot for Authentic Sushi,"I visited during a weekday lunch. When I arrived after 11:00, about 70% of the seats were filled. I noticed around 30% of the guests were foreigners. One person, who seemed to be from NY and looked like a Chinese expatriate, was expressing his amazement, repeatedly telling the sushi chef how great it was. The chef could only respond with 'thank you,' and I thought it would have been nice if he had engaged a bit more; it felt a bit lacking in interaction, haha.We only had sushi, and as far as I can recall, we ordered a variety: lean tuna, fatty tuna, sea urchin, eel, kohada, marinated mackerel, shima aji, salmon roe, tekka maki, and octopus.The sushi rice was made with red vinegar, and most of the toppings were lightly brushed with soy sauce. The sushi rice was so delicious!Also, since I usually go to places like Sushiro, this may be typical, but the wasabi was just a small amount and very spicy, and the gari (pickled ginger) was delightful!I was particularly impressed by the white fish and shima aji. The marinated mackerel and shima aji were exceptional. I felt the same level of excitement as the time I had sushi that cost around JPY 20,000. It was truly delicious. I highly recommend it! I even ordered those two items twice.However, at the entrance of the restaurant, there was a strong odor, possibly from a drainage system, which was quite unpleasant and smelled like sewage. ItÅfs a bit disappointing to be hit with such a smell right before entering a lovely restaurant in Omotesando. I want to enter and leave feeling good, but I found the experience a bit disappointing both when entering and exiting.But most importantly, the taste of the sushi was absolutely perfect!"
Inspired by the Yosakoi Festival,"I had been keeping an eye on Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera for a while, and I finally made my first visit in between the Yosakoi Festival events happening in Harajuku and Omotesando.The restaurant collaborates with renowned wholesalers, including Yamako, to ensure a lineup of always top-quality ingredients. Everything is prepared in-house with intricate knife techniques, providing beautifully crafted Edomae sushi infused with the chef's heartfelt touch.Despite the formal presentation, you can enjoy authentic Edomae sushi at a great price.The ordering and payment system is quite streamlined, making the overall dining experience smooth, although there may be some wait times.Not being a fan of sipping sake with snacks, I began my meal with the top-grade tuna belly from Yamako, which was exceptional alongside the red vinegar rice.Other offerings included homemade simmered conger eel, perfectly grilled sardines, seared salmon, seasonal grilled knife fish, and a crab towerall of which were delightful. When you feel like eating, thatÅfs when it tastes best! "
Luxury Kaiten Sushi!,"Kaiten sushi from Ginza Onodera!ThereÅfs no doubt the ingredients are top-notch and absolutely delicious.They offer both single and double pieces, and we shared the double plates to try a variety.Everything we tried was tasty, but the medium fatty tuna and the three types of sea urchin comparison were the highlights!I definitely want to go back!Osu Osu!"
Casual Non-Rotating Sushi,"Although it's labeled as kaiten sushi, the ordering is done via a touch panel, so nothing actually rotates on the conveyor.I visited to introduce a place that feels casual yet respectable for my overseas friends who have only been to major chain kaiten sushi.The touch panel supports multiple languages, making ordering and payment clear and easy.The gari (pickled ginger) and wasabi are also part of the touch panel options, but I think one serving of wasabi is enough for two people unless you really love wasabi.The performance of the fish preparation is also quite enjoyable.Water and tea are self-service.The restroom is extremely small, haha.Although the counter seats were close together, the tempura and other dishes were tasty, making it a good choice for casual sushi.It's a bit pricier compared to Hanamitsu, I think?It wasnÅft as crowded as when it first opened, which was nice.You can also reserve a spot through EPARK, which is a plus."
Completely tailored to your preferences,"I was able to visit again on a weekday evening in July. Fortunately, I was seated without any wait right after I arrived, but there was quite a line behind me. ItÅfs interesting how just a few minutes can change your fate regarding wait times. I definitely recommend arriving earlier.During my previous visit, shellfish were in season, and I ordered the Kitakuri clam as it was recommended by the restaurant. However, it didnÅft have the same sweetness or melt-in-your-mouth texture as beforeÅc I enjoyed the reliable fish with shine and white flesh!Also, I ordered the Tai-to and received some good-natured cheers from the staff.Next time, I want to choose my sushi according to the seasonal offerings!"
Premium Kaiten Sushi,"Kaiten Sushi Onodera in Omotesando offers slightly higher-priced sushi.The fact that you can only order up to four dishes at a time adds a sense of refinement, avoiding any feeling of cheapness.Overall, the food is very delicious and served quickly.I ordered a lot and it came to JPY 5000 for one person.I think this is quite a good deal.I definitely want to visit again!"
Heard it's a promising young sushi establishment,"You can reserve your spot through your smartphone, and because the rotation is efficient, it's convenient for shopping while you wait. The touch panel makes it easy to place orders, and I ended up ordering more than I intended. This time, I was able to order items from the Kyoto branch, and there were unique offerings that you can't find elsewhere, which was great."
Finally made it to Onodera!,"I finally made it to Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera!Upon sitting down, the chef greeted me and introduced the seasonal specials.This visit marks the opening of their Kyoto branch, so they shared some Kyoto-themed dishes with us.~What I ordered~Å° Draft BeerÅ° Hamo (pike eel) NigiriÅ° Yamazaki Hon Maguro (red tuna)Å° Suzuki (sea bass)Å° Engawa (flounder fin) Shio Aburi (lightly grilled with salt)Å° Sprouted LeeksÅ° Kochi (flatfish)Å° Atago no Matsu Junmai Ginjo (pure rice ginjo sake)Å° Live Turbo ShellÅ° H-shredded Kishu Nankou Ume (pickled plum) Hosomaki (thin roll)Å° Assorted PicklesÅ° Kinme Dai (red snapper)Å° Ao Highball (blue highball)Å° Homemade Shime Saba Kombu Maki (mackerel wrapped in kelp)The famous Yamazaki tuna certainly had a distinctive touch to it.The engawa melted in my mouth in no time...The texture and chewiness of the turbo shell was completely different from what I've had at other places, and I found it quite innovative.The pickles from the so-called Kyoto fair paired well with the drinks.As I savored my meal, I realized I had more dishes I wanted to try, but I was too full to continue, so I had to say goodbye.I will definitely come back!"
"Distinctive features like using red vinegar in the rice set it apart from traditional conveyor belt sushi, but the taste feels just average for the price.","<Ordered items>Yama Ko Hon Maguro Chutoro JPY 620Yama Ko Hon Maguro Tekka Hosomaki JPY 510<Review>I happened to visit this place while strolling around Omotesando in the morning when there was no line.Originally, it was a food service outsourcing company called LEOC, but it formed the ONODERA GROUP in 2018.I had visited their Ginza location before, but this was my first time dining at a kaiten sushi establishment.The store itself is pretty much just an average kaiten sushi restaurant.I expected it to be a bit more upscale, but the interior decor was standard for the type.Ordering is done via a touchscreen, and water is self-serve, which is completely normal for kaiten sushi.What sets this place apart is the high quality of the ingredients and the sushi craftsmanship.They used tuna from 'Yama Ko', and I recall that the famous tuna shop 'Irifune', which used to be in Okusawa, Setagaya, also sourced its fish from Yama Ko.They use red vinegar for the rice, and the toppings come pre-seasoned with soy sauce, indicating a quality closer to that of upscale establishments.While I'm not an expert in sushi, my impression was that it felt a bit 'bland' in comparison to truly high-end sushi places, so there was a noticeable difference.That said, the price range is higher than regular kaiten sushi, similar to Kanazawa Maimon Sushi.Overall, I might consider visiting again if there is no line.<Concerns>From my personal perspective, the satisfaction level of high-end kaiten sushi seems a bit lacking for the price, and honestly, it might be better to visit a more upscale restaurant that offers lunch service."
Delicious Marinated Tuna,"ItÅfs about a 15-minute walk from Harajuku Station. You can find it inside BOSS, directly across from the Apple Store.The restaurant is lively, and during peak hours even on weekdays, it seems like you might have to wait a considerable amount to get in.There were also many foreign customers.If you get a little carried away and start ordering a lot, the prices can quickly become comparable to a typical sushi restaurant.The marinated tuna is delicious, and I ended up having four pieces!"
Affordable Sushi without the Conveyor Belt,"This isn't your typical conveyor belt sushi, as you place orders using a touch panel. Delicious, crispy sushi arrives promptly. Additionally, there are limited-time specials available every hour; during my visit, it was sea urchin. It was my first time trying fresh sea urchin in its shell! I was able to enjoy a full, satisfying meal at a great price."
Onodera Quality at Kaiten Sushi,"I decided to visit this sushi restaurant, which is the kaiten sushi version of the famous Ginza Onodera.With young children, itÅfs great to find a sushi place of this quality that allows kids.Naturally, there was a wait (I heard there was even a TV filming while we waited), but the owner was extremely attentive, so it didnÅft feel burdensome at all.We were shown to a private room, allowing us to enjoy our meal comfortably.Everything we ordered was far above the usual kaiten sushi level.The handroll with sea urchin, in particular, was incredibly delicious.All items were of high quality, making this a must-visit restaurant for a repeat experience."
Luxury Kaiten Sushi!,"Kaiten Sushi Ginza OnoderaI've been curious about this high-end sushi restaurant in Ginza that offers affordable options.On weekends during lunch, there can be a wait of about 30 groups, but when I arrived at 16:30, there was hardly any wait.I enjoyed a variety of dishes including fatty tuna  medium fatty tuna  sea urchin, scallops, etc. I had many more than what I photographed! The sushi rice is slightly smaller than usual, so I could keep eating more!The beer was a smaller glass I think I drank about 5 in an hour! As a drinker, I wish the glasses were a bit larger!You can enjoy high-end sushi in a casual setting (*^É÷^*)ÅôÅ[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[ÅôI appreciate your follows, likes, and comments! I'm also on Instagram, so please check out my posts there too. Å® @m_tokyo_gourmet"
Everyday Go-To Spot: Onodera,"I had been to [a:13153824,Sushi Onodera] in Ginza before, but this was my first time at their new concept.I had been curious about Kaiten Sushi Onodera ever since I saw it on TV.ThereÅfs always a line at their Omotesando branch, but I arrived just after opening and walked right in without waiting.The sushi here uses Onodera's red vinegar, and while it doesn't quite compare to the original in Ginza, it's a convenient sushi spot for a casual meal.The flatfish, horse mackerel, medium fatty tuna, and their signature toro-taku (fatty tuna with takuan) were delicious.All this for just a little over JPY 5000 per person.What a great price!"
Authentic yet Affordable Kaiten Sushi Experience,"I visited for dinner on Sunday.I had to wait about 30 minutes to get in.Around 7 PM, I saw on the touchscreen that there was no lean meat or green onions available.When I inquired, it seemed there was an error on the restaurant's end that wasnÅft updated.The staff also handed items over without mentioning anything, and I received some things I didnÅft order, which made it feel a bit disorganized. It was a little disappointing.It was a great meal."
High-Quality and Delicious Restaurant,"I finally visited a restaurant I've been curious about.It's easy to enter even when dining alone, and they guide you through the process.Every sushi piece was delicious! It was a truly happy experience.  The yellowtail had large slices and great flavorabsolutely top-notch! The seared salmon was so good that I wanted to order it again.  The uni tasting was also amazing!The prices were JPY 2,500 for uni, JPY 900 for snow crab, and other items were around JPY 500 to 600. I wish they were about JPY 100-200 cheaper. It feels more like a price target towards foreign tourists taking advantage of the weak yen rather than a luxurious dining experience (laughs).I noticed that the red vinegar rice was somewhat weak in holding its shape, as it crumbled and couldn't be picked up twice. Is this just how it is? Personally, I prefer rice that holds its shape a bit better when molded. I'm not sure if this is the standard here, so I'll need to come back to check.The seafood is fresh, thick, and delicious,and since I can enjoy slightly upscale sushi in a casual setting, I plan to visit again."
Unclear values...,"I visited around 4 PM on a weekday for a sushi snack. I originally aimed for the standing sushi bar, but perhaps due to the day of the week or the rotation, the seating area had more open spots. The standing bar seemed to be closed. At that time, the vacancies were noticeable, and I was seated right away. While the touch panel ordering is convenient, I found the menu hard to read. Is it just me? From the limited time recommendations, I ordered the shirasu (young sardine) gunkan for JPY 510, the grilled knife fish for JPY 620, and the grilled kawakawa. The prices are quite high. The sushi was normally tasty, but I didn't find it outstanding for the price. So, I decided to try the special shrimp miso half ramen for JPY 470. It says 'half ramen', but there were only about three bites of noodles. Is that really half? More like mini? No, maybe micro?! Haha! I consider myself accustomed to sushi, but I really donÅft understand the value of this place. For me, my regular spot in Nemuro offers a much higher satisfaction level. For five pieces of sushi and a micro ramen at JPY 2300... Hmm... I don't think I'll be coming back."
Luxury Kaiten Sushi!,"I made a reservation through EPARK right before leaving home, which allowed me to check how many people were waiting online. It was convenient because I could stroll around Aoyama until my reserved time!When it got close, I received a call for my number, so I waited nearby.There are both a conveyor belt sushi style and a counter where chefs prepare sushi directly, but I opted for the conveyor belt sushi as it seemed a bit more affordable.The ingredients are the same, so I chose this option. I could pick as many as I wanted from the panel, and there were daily recommendations, which added up to a considerable amount...That said, I could also check my order history on the panel, which was reassuring!"
Delicious sushi at a popular restaurant!,"I visited ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" on a holiday afternoon. It's a well-known restaurant frequently featured in media like TV and magazines. I've been to the adjacent ""Tachikui Sushi Onodera"" but this was my first time at the main branch.During lunch hours, there's usually a long wait, but since I visited in the evening, I was seated almost immediately. By the way, they have EPARK, so there's no need to line up.Ordering is done via a touchscreen panel, and the special red sushi rice is the same as at ""Tachikui Sushi Onodera"".HereÅfs what I ordered:- Yamazaki Hon Maguro Akami- Yamazaki Hon Maguro Chutoro- Homemade Simmered Anago- Negitoro Gunkan- Seared Engawa- Fresh Octopus from Hokkaido- Raw Salmon- Bonito- Live Abalone- Live Kanpachi- True Horse Mackerel- Dan Dan NoodlesEverything was delicious! Especially the tuna from Yamazaki. Both the Chutoro and Akami were excellent. The abalone was crunchy and packed with flavor, making it very enjoyable.The Dan Dan noodles had a nice kick with a spicy tingle.While the current seating arrangement is comfortable, the craftsmanship at the previously visited ""Tachikui Sushi Onodera"" left a stronger impression of detail.I had a wonderful meal. It was a great meal! (^.^)"
This place is great!,"To be honest, I was skeptical at first, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had previously tried the standing sushi bar in the same location, and it was quite disappointinghalf-hearted effort, really. I thought this place would be just as underwhelming, but I was wrong. What a surprise! It was fantastic. The sushi was delicious and, given the quality, it was quite affordable. I truly had my expectations exceeded."
Be aware that Kaiten Sushi and Stand-Up Sushi have different price points.,"I visited during the daytime on a holiday. Kaiten Sushi Onodera and Tachigui Sushi Onodera share the same space. Since there was no line at the Tachigui side, I entered, but be careful as the menu is different from the kaiten sushi! The Tachigui is quite pricey, with each piece costing around JPY 700. I had 5 pieces for a total of JPY 3600. The taste is fantastic! However, the entry system might cause some confusion..."
Kaiten Sushi Onodera,"I visited the famous Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera! I've had their sushi before, but this was my first experience at their kaiten sushi. The quality is outstandingit's not what you'd expect from a conveyor belt sushi place! The flavors were so good that I was speechless and ended up ordering too much. It was an absolutely fantastic restaurant! I'll definitely stop by again when I'm in the area! I'm a bit shocked that this is the only photo I took, though!"
Completely tailored to your preferences,"I was able to visit again on a weekday evening in July. Fortunately, I was seated without any wait right after I arrived, but there was quite a line behind me. ItÅfs interesting how just a few minutes can change your fate regarding wait times. I definitely recommend arriving earlier.During my previous visit, shellfish were in season, and I ordered the Kitakuri clam as it was recommended by the restaurant. However, it didnÅft have the same sweetness or melt-in-your-mouth texture as beforeÅc I enjoyed the reliable fish with shine and white flesh!Also, I ordered the Tai-to and received some good-natured cheers from the staff.Next time, I want to choose my sushi according to the seasonal offerings!"
"For the best Chutoro, this is the place!","This is my third visit to the restaurant.The tuna from Yamako is undeniably delicious, especially the medium fatty tuna.Today, the lean tuna was not as good as usual.Highlights from today's offerings:Åù Freshly Caught Kanpachi - very firmÅù Fresh OctopusÅù Medium Fatty TunaÅù MackerelÅù Red Clam - it was so large that it came in two pieces instead of one! Today's fresh sardines were also a bit lacking."
Absolutely delicious!,"Of course, it was delicious. The rice seasoned with red vinegar was incredibly tasty, and the toppings were just as good. The tuna, in particular, was delicious and came from 'Yama Ko'. ItÅfs the perfect amount for a light bite. This time, we were able to get in without much waiting, but usually, thereÅfs quite a line. The staff were also very attentive, making for a pleasant dining experience."
"A rare kaiten sushi experience in Omotesando, offering easy access to famous sushi from Ginza.","Located right next to Hugo Boss in Omotesando, this sushi restaurant may differ from high-end spots in Ginza, but it offers a casual yet high-quality kaiten sushi experience under the same brand.As you enter, if you head to the right, you'll find a counter where skilled artisans prepare sushi right before your eyes, rather than a typical rotating sushi area.Here, you can place your orders via a tablet, and the freshly made nigiri sushi is served right in front of you. Everything is fresh and delicious. The seasonal nigiri, in particular, offers amazing flavors at reasonable prices. What stood out to me were the sea urchin, flounder, and the exceptional squid.In addition to the rotating sushi menu, there are a few sushi items available for ordering, and I also tried the natto roll, which was absolutely delightful.To finish off, I had a bowl of authentic miso ramen, and although I was completely satisfied, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the entire meal was offered at under JPY 10,000, making it a fantastic value for the quality."
Average Kaiten Sushi Experience,"Sigh...I want to stop being drawn to restaurants that usually have long lines just because this one is empty.As the title suggests, my impression is just that.Whenever I go to a conveyor sushi place, I always think that I should save that money and go to a good restaurant instead, yet I often end up here...Is it tasty for the price?I don't think it holds that much value.The horse mackerel was poorly prepared and not fresh at all.I believe the chawanmushi (steamed egg custard) is the same level as a cheap conveyor belt sushi chain (IÅfm not sure if they even serve chawanmushi at Sushiro).I looked at the price from the image I attached, and I see that the marinated fish is JPY 510!? What a shock. It makes me feel sad..."
Casual Dining at Yamako,"While high-end restaurants offering omakase courses are undeniably delicious, there are times when you simply want to select what you want to eat freely.I had a strong craving for sardines and decided to revisit this place based on my previous positive experience. I was worried about the crowd due to the inbound tourism, but surprisingly, I arrived around 11:40 on a weekday and had almost no waiting time. What a relief! ÅôThis restaurant, Onodera, is well-known since it's featured during the first auction at Toyosu.I appreciate that they serve real bluefin tuna from Yamako at this conveyor sushi restaurant. The conveyor belt is still at a standstill, as usual. Of course, I ordered the medium fatty tuna, and in addition to the regular sardines, there was a new itemgrilled sardines.I noticed slight acidity from the vinegar-marinated raw sardines, so I preferred the grilled version. It was topped with fried green onions. The winter sardines were rich in fat and delicious.On that day, there were also grilled swordfish and boiled snow crab available. The marinated ikura (salmon roe) was delightful.I was disappointed to learn that the boiled sweet shrimp was sold out (ÅGÅG)During my last visit in early summer, I realized that fish taste better in winter and appreciated that I could order as much medium fatty tuna as I wanted today. Last time, there were fewer types of ingredients available."
Casual and delicious sushi that keeps you coming back for more,"IÅfve visited many times, whether alone or with friends.Recently, there have been many international customers, making it quite lively.IÅfve never been able to enter without waiting, but I often come here when I want sushi, even though IÅfm not quite hungry enough for a full course."
The Best of High-End Sushi and Neighborhood Kaiten Sushi,"I arrived around 2 PM. I underestimated the crowdÅc I didnÅft expect such a long line. ItÅfs clear that itÅfs Golden Week, especially popular among foreigners. I waited for about an hour to get a table, but it was quicker than I thought.I tried a variety of dishes including a comparison of three types of sea urchin (Bafun uni, Shio mizu uni, Murasaki uni), kuruma ebi (Japanese tiger prawn), botan ebi (sweet shrimp), ikura (salmon roe), toro-taku (fatty tuna with pickles), and scallops. However, the standout items were definitely the tuna and shrimpthey were absolutely delicious! You can really taste the difference from low-cost conveyor belt sushi; the quality of the tuna was a whole different level, which was quite surprising!I enjoyed it so much that I ordered more.Overall, everything was incredibly high standard for a conveyor sushi restaurant! I was very satisfied. The touch panel for ordering was easy to understand as well. Whether IÅfll queue for another hour is a different story, but it was an entertaining experience, and IÅfd love to visit again!"
"[Shibuya] A gateway to great sushi...

Best Sushi in Omotesando,"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera's Omotesando branch.I was lucky to be the first in line, arriving 20 minutes before opening.Honestly, everything I tasted was delicious. The quality of sushi at this level is simply incredible.I especially recommend the sea urchin. There are multiple varieties, and as someone who used to be hesitant about eating it, I found it truly delightful!Each piece is a bit pricey, but you absolutely must try it at least once. It will change your perspective on sushi."
"Sharing the essence of Japan's authentic culture with the world. Impressed by the skill of the red rice and the Takabe. At Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera (Shibuya, Tokyo), enjoy a comparison of premium tuna and Kue, exquisite sea urchin tasting, homemade simmered anago, kohada, Takabe, and Yagara.","While the food and taste received a Åö4.0 rating, the low impression of service and cost performance led to an overall rating of Åö3.4. Although I felt that it deserved a score above my personal best of Åö3.5, there were some downsides.I came to Tokyo to attend a hot spring workshop held in Aoyama. But first, I decided to grab a bite to eat. Since I was treating myself to a sushi experience, I opted for a visit to ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" instead of the usual Ginza sushi.This year marks the third consecutive year that ONODERA GROUP acquired the top tuna at the New YearÅfs auction at Toyosu Market. They operate 13 locations across five regions worldwide, three of which have been awarded Michelin stars. With the concept of allowing more people to enjoy traditional Edomae sushi, they opened the main branch of Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in October 2021. A second branch is planned to open in Shijo Kawaramachi, Kyoto, between June and July 2023.I had been checking the reservation site for two weeks prior, hoping to visit at the earliest hour in the morning. Even on a Sunday, it seemed that there wouldnÅft be much of a crowd right after opening, which gave me peace of mind to explore the nearby supermarkets before heading over.I confirmed that there was no wait time through the reservation site. The main branch of Ginza Onodera features an omakase course that costs tens of thousands of yen, which is a bit out of reach for regular folks like me. IÅfve only ever dined at Ginza sushi on company expenses and never paid for it myself. This branch, however, offers a chance to enjoy ""Onodera"" at a reasonable price, which I was looking forward to.Ordering was straightforward with a touch panel, clearly displaying the prices, and it was great that I could order individual pieces, making it convenient for someone like me who prefers smaller portions but enjoys various types of fish. This setup ensures that even first-time visitors like me, who might not be familiar with red rice and the intricacies of Edomae sushi, could enjoy their experience with confidence.As I entered the restaurant, I was slightly taken aback by the loud greetings reminiscent of regular conveyor sushi. I took a deep breath as I made my choices. I started with tuna.Åö Yamazaki Hon Maguro Chutoro  1 Piece 620 JPYÅö Yamazaki Hon Maguro Akami  1 Piece 420 JPYIt was nice to see not only the origin marked as ""Choshi"" but also the specific fishing port indicated.After a while, I relished the long-awaited Yamazaki tuna. The decorative knife work was beautiful. The chutoro was delicious as expected, while the akami left something to be desired. However, I could still appreciate the difference compared to regular hon maguro. I am more inclined towards Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) over Atlantic bluefin (T. thynnus) and have rediscovered that the choice of seasonal regions and careful selection of fish are crucial when evaluating hon maguro.Åö Yamazaki Hon Maguro Nakao Gunkan  620 JPYWhile it did not fully meet my expectations, it was certainly still above the quality of typical conveyor sushi, and the garnishes were well done.Åö Ultimate Uni Comparative Tasting  2 Pieces 1,950 JPYHokkaidoÅfs Bafun Uni and Murasaki Uni gunkan. Unfortunately, both were a bit melted, which was disappointing. I realized that even Onodera served this type of uni; it was a valuable experience in a way. Perhaps they didnÅft use myoubank (an agent used to firm up uni)? Bafun uni had a mediocre flavor, while the murasaki uni was enjoyable and notably better than the seasonal murasaki uni I had previously tried at a directly managed shop on Rebun Island in Hokkaido.However, the appearance of the murasaki uni I had in February at a sushi shop in Aomori left a better impression.I decided to ask the young staff preparing the sushi about the origin, but when I asked for clarification, I received a somewhat curt response of ""Hokkaido,"" leaving me unable to gather details about the fishing port. While the tuna had its port displayed, the uniÅfs origin and port remained a mystery, which was a slight letdown. I wonder if itÅfs because this is a budget-friendly kaiten sushi place, or if even the higher-priced main branch engages in this level of service. Perhaps it was a question I shouldnÅft have asked. As someone who trained rigorously in etiquette during my career to obtain three stars, it was a somewhat disappointing aspect of my experience.Åö Homemade Simmered Anago  1 Piece 640 JPYOf course, the techniques of Edomae stand out. The reduction sauce was incredible, although the flavor of the anago itself was average (yet still vastly superior to typical chain conveyor sushi).Åö Homemade Kohada  1 Piece 340 JPYI hesitated among saba, aji, and iwashi, but when it comes to Edomae, kohada is a must. It is noticeably better than chain store kohada, but I still think it could use a bit more visual appeal in preparation.Åö Kue Comparison  1,400 JPYWhile the staff gave some explanation upon serving, I couldnÅft catch the details from their voice, so I remain unsure which kue this is or whether itÅfs wild or farmed, which left me a bit curious considering the previous experience with uni. In the end, I ate without fully understanding the meaning of Ågcomparison.Åh It was good, but compared to the natural kue I had at a conveyor sushi place in Shingu City, Wakayama, I felt the taste of the fat was somewhat lacking. Åö Gari  0 JPYI also ordered this through the tablet. I have never seen such beautiful gari in my life. Truly impressive.Åö Aburi Takabe  2 Pieces 650 JPYThis was introduced as a ""new item"". Takabe is a member of the Suzuki family. ÅgTakaÅh refers to rocky reefs, while ÅgbeÅh means fish. While regarded as a premium fish in Kanto, itÅfs not commonly caught in my local area, so itÅfs popularity and availability is rather limited. Still, this offering truly represents what ""Onodera"" is about.For me, this was the highlight of the meal.Åö Yagara  2 Pieces 510 JPYThe staff proudly showcased a large yagaras. It was the biggest one I had ever seen.Finally, I tried Onodera's red rice (red vinegared rice). It is made with Hitomebore from Akita and aged and fermented using sake lees.Each grain stood out distinctly.I was truly impressed and felt fortunate to have eaten this red vinegared ricethis was the greatest takeaway from my visit. I was thrilled and deeply moved.Recently, I havenÅft been able to enjoy sashimi as much as I used to, and sushi the same. But with this visit to Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, I proudly reaffirmed the deliciousness of Edomae sushi. The total bill of 7,150 JPY felt incredibly reasonable. I slightly regretted not trying the sea urchin sashimi, kelp-wrapped mackerel, and castella egg as well. In conclusion, I can eat delicious food endlessly, but only within the range of what I can afford.================Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch1F Il Palazzino Omotesando, 5-1-6 Jinguumae, Shibuya, TokyoTel: 050-3085-1700Closed: Irregular holidaysHours: 10:30-22:30(Last entry at 21:30, last order at 22:00)Seating: 31 Counter seats, 4 tables for 4, and 2 private rooms for 6, total of 59 seatsMake a reservation here."
Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in Omotesando!,"I heard that Onodera, which operates sushi restaurants in Hawaii and Ginza, has opened a casual brand of kaiten sushi in Omotesando, so I decided to drop by. The tuna is sourced from Yamasachi, and I was able to taste different varieties of sea urchin, which was great. Ordering is done via tablets, making it easy for international customers to make selections. Moreover, there are also premium champagnes and wines, suggesting it is likely geared towards inbound tourists. Overall, it feels like an elevated experience compared to regular kaiten sushi."
"Not a rotating sushi, but high-end sushi! Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera is the place to go! (^O^)Ém","On Wednesday, it was the first day of the Sakurazaka46 tour at Yoyogi National Gymnasium (^ ^)Ém.Before that, I stopped by ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" located in Omotesando to fill up on some good food (^O^)Ém.As the name suggests, this is the main branch of Onodera, a conveyor sushi restaurant that is focusing on training young sushi chefs (^ ^). Onodera has been gaining attention in recent years for their collaboration with ""Yama Ko"", known as the ""best tuna wholesaler in Japan"", where they auction off top-grade tuna at Toyosu (^O^)ÅÙÅÙ.Even though itÅfs a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, Onodera offers fish of nearly the same quality as their main store, thanks to their partnership with Yama Ko (^ ^).Of course, this means the prices are higher than typical conveyor sushi (lol).Currently, due to COVID-19, the conveyor belt is not in operation, allowing us to enjoy freshly made sushiÅÙÅÙ.I visited around 4 PM, a rather quiet time, and there weren't many customers (^ ^).I was seated at the counter, where I could order via a touch panel, and there was a great variety of interesting sushi on offerÅÙÅÙ.I decided to order to my heart's content (lol).HereÅfs what I had today:- Katsuo- Ainame- Sardine (1 piece) x2- Mejima Tuna- Homemade Kohada (1 piece)- Sawara- Engawa- Aburabouzu- Yama Ko's Hon Tuna Akami- Horse dung sea urchin gunkan (1 piece)- Yama Ko's Hon Tuna Otoro (1 piece)- Homemade simmered Anago (1 piece)- Homemade Onodera ChawanmushiThe standard serving is two pieces, but some are available individually.They mainly serve nigiri, and some pieces are seasoned with saltÅÙÅÙ.I was especially thrilled with the Ainame, Mejima Tuna, Sawara, and Aburabouzu (^O^)ÅÙÅÙ.While Ainame can be found at some places, not many serve it regularly.Sawara is a personal favorite and I always order it when it's fresh!!It was delicious, although I had to deal with some grated daikon on top (TÅ§T)Ém.And then there was the Mejima TunaMejima is the juvenile of Hon Tuna, and opportunities to try juvenile tuna under a certain size are quite rare (Å@ﬂÑtﬂ).Juvenile tuna aren't displayed in the markets as you might expect, they are usually treated as regular fish (^ ^).However, itÅfs also not common to see them in supermarkets, so I couldn't resist trying it (lol).ItÅfs likely they used a fatty part for this dish, and it was very fresh and pleasant to eat (^O^)Ém.And then there's AburabouzuThis is quite rare and not easy to find (Å@ﬂÑtﬂ).I had never tasted it before, and while it was lightly seared, it was rich in fat, essentially like a ""whole piece of Otoro"" (lol).Moreover, it lacked any strong fishiness or excess fatvery delicious!!However, since Aburabouzu has a lot of fat, itÅfs also known as ""Oshitsuke"", and eating too much can lead to digestion issues (Å@ﬂÑtﬂ).So, even though it's tasty, itÅfs best to stop at about two pieces (^ ^)ÅÙÅÙ.While nearing the end of my meal, I suddenly realized I hadnÅft drunk anything yet (lol).So I quickly ordered a draft beer and a lemon sour, finishing off with Chawanmushi in the end!!Then it was off to see the Sakurazaka46 live concert (^ ^)ÅÙÅÙ.Thank you for the meal! IÅfll be sure to visit the main branch next time (^O^)Ém."
A tourist-friendly restaurant,"I visited on a Friday evening and the restaurant was about half full. It had a lot of couples seated at the counter. The atmosphere was brighter than I expected based on the photos. At the counter, there were paper towels and a full set of items typically found in kaiten sushi. I also noticed that the Japanese tea was the type where you pour hot water over powdered tea yourself. Since this place is known for its tuna, I initially ordered the medium fatty tuna and the recommended five pieces. Perhaps my expectations were too high; they were rather average. However, the freshness of the raw mackerel, live surf clams, and striped jack was delightful, and I enjoyed the mild flavor of the pickled ginger. But I understand, it might be different since it's currently that season for tuna."
Best Value Conveyer Belt Sushi,"I went shopping in Omotesando. It's really helpful that this place is open all day. I had to start with the maguro from Yamakou. I'm truly delighted by the taste at this price for conveyor belt sushi. All the sushi here is delicious, and this is definitely my favorite conveyor belt sushi spot. They also have a kids' menu and fish slicing shows, which adds to the fun. Even foreign visitors were enjoying themselves. I'll be back again!"
Lunch Visit,"I arrived at the restaurant at 10:40 after taking a flight to Haneda and heading straight to Omotesando, but even at that time, about 70% of the seats were filled. By 11:00, it was fully booked.The concept here is to enjoy the sushi from Ginza Onodera casually at a kaiten sushi restaurant. However, upon entering, I noticed that while the conveyor belt was moving, no sushi was actually circulating! Instead, there's a system where you order via a touchscreen and the sushi is delivered to your table.The quality of the sushi was excellent, and it was surprisingly reasonable given the quality. ItÅfs no wonder thereÅfs a queue.(I apologize for the poor color in some of the photos.)"
Everything was delicious today except for the mackerel.,"I initially planned to visit a hamburger place called ""Yosh"" that just opened on the 16th, but it was temporarily closed, so I headed towards Omotesando Hills. On the way, I remembered that I hadnÅft been to ""Onodera"" in a while, so I decided to drop by.I was able to enter without waiting. HereÅfs what I ordered, in the order they were served:- 2 pieces of Shima Aji (JPY 650) - Delicious!- 2 pieces of Shime Saba (JPY 440) - Unfortunately, the Shime Saba was disappointing again. The last time, the fish wasnÅft great either...- 1 piece of Kohada (JPY 340) - The Kohada today was quite good.- 1 piece of Mackerel (JPY 280) - The mackerel was decent today.- 1 piece of Horse Mackerel (JPY 280) - The horse mackerel was excellent today.- 1 piece of Simmered Anago (JPY 640) - I believe this was my first time having the simmered anago here, and it was soft and flavorful, well-prepared with a rich glaze.- 2 pieces of Medium Fatty Tuna (JPY 620) - Was it about the size of a medium one? It had a relatively light flavor, which is understandable for tuna in March.- 1 Tuna Toro Takumaki (JPY 720) - It was okay.As I mentioned during my first visit, the sushi rice uses red vinegar, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. While the Shime Saba didnÅft impress, the other fish was better than last time, and the anago exceeded my expectations.Spending JPY 3970 for lunch is certainly not cheap, but worthwhile."
Family's Favorite Kaiten Sushi,"For Valentine's Day, I was taken out to this restaurant. Since it was a holiday, it was even busier than usual.We ordered:- Cold Yellowtail- Medium Fatty Tuna from Yamakou- Salmon Roe- Cod Milt Gunkan- Grilled Salmon with Saikyo Miso- Grilled Fluke with Saikyo Miso- Boiled Snow Crab- Seafood Chawanmushi- Shoyu Ramen- Fried Chicken- French Fries- Overflowing Shirasu Gunkan- Udon- Dashimaki TamagoThe service was fast, and not only were the nigiri excellent, but the quality of the side dishes was also high, making it a favorite for everyone!"

The Best Kaiten Sushi,"Just a few minutes walk from Omotesando Station, this restaurant allows you to enjoy sushi from a famous sushi shop in a conveyor belt style.The interior mostly features a counter, with a few tables at the back.You can order sushi via a tablet, and as soon as you place your order, the sushi chef right in front of you prepares it.The quality is exceptional for a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, with each piece crafted with great care.Every piece of sushi was delicious, and the service was very pleasant, making for a wonderful experience.Even for those who find high-end sushi restaurants intimidating, this place offers an authentic sushi experience in a relaxed setting.It was a great meal."
Ultimate Conveyor Belt Sushi,"I tried medium fatty tuna, tuna, scallops, akagai (red clam), and tekkamaki (tuna roll). I had just a little since it was before dinner, but each piece was exquisite and carefully selected. The scallops and lean tuna were personally my favorites! I definitely want to go back. Since it was around 3 PM, I was able to enter smoothly."
Seasonal and Uniquely Delicious Sushi,"If you're craving seasonal, rare, and delicious sushi, I highly recommend this place.- Active Kuruma Ebi- Meji Maguro (Bluefin Tuna)- Houbou (Flatfish)- Ebi (Shrimp) Comparison- Aka Ebi (Red Shrimp) & Botan Ebi (Butterfly Shrimp)- Sudachi Buri (Yellowtail)- Kue (Brown Grouper) ComparisonThe comparison of Botan Ebi and Aka Ebi both featured plump, sweet meat that was absolutely exquisite.Houbou is a must-try for white fish lovers, boasting a delightful texture with a sweet taste.The Kue comparison also offered a delightful meatiness and sweetness, making it a dish that white fish enthusiasts will come to crave.Sudachi Buri was perfectly fatty, with a refreshing aspect from the Sudachi citrus, making it a dish you'll want to order repeatedly.While the prices are slightly higher than other conveyor sushi spots, this sushi restaurant is definitely worth the splurge, making you want to treat yourself to a visit 3 to 5 times a month."
Surprising Bill After All-You-Can-Eat at Popular Kaiten Sushi in Omotesando?!,"After indulging in all-you-can-eat luxury sushi, I was shocked by the final bill...This restaurant, ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,"" was created with the concept of providing high-quality sushi in a more accessible way.I was able to enter without waiting, likely due to visiting on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets busy with tourists on weekends, requiring a longer wait.I started with the ""Luxury Shrimp Trio (JPY 980),"" ""Comparison of Kue (JPY 1400),"" and ""Two Pieces of Fresh Medium Fatty Tuna (JPY 620),"" along with some signature Japanese sake.The sake was served with a performance as it was poured over the counter, which I highly recommend!I continued to order dish after dish, enjoying what I desired.In total, I ended up eating about 20 plates alone. The highlights were the sea urchin comparison and the surf clam.While all the dishes were of much higher quality than standard conveyor belt sushi, the price also reflected that...It made me question the cost-performance ratio!However, the luxurious atmosphere in the Omotesando location is definitely enjoyable!And as for the total price... please check the last photo!"
When I hear about red vinegar...,"I heard they use red vinegar and wanted to try it at least once, so I visited on our wedding anniversary. It was estimated that I would wait for two hours after checking in through the touch panel, but I received a call after about an hour. Maybe it was because there was a 60-minute limit or other customers gave up, but I was guided to my seat sooner than expected. I went in the early evening, but there were quite a few items sold out. If you have something specific you want, I recommend arriving early.As for the red vinegar, I couldn't really discern its taste! The sushi was incredibly delicious However, I just couldn't taste the red vinegar at all. The seared engawa (flounder fin) truly impressed me.It's a must-try for engawa lovers! If asked whether I would visit again... I'm unsure (laughs)."
Sushi that surpasses the quality of conveyor belt sushi!,"I arrived before the opening time and noticed several groups were already waiting, and more people kept arriving after us. ItÅfs clear that this place is popular.The ordering was done via a touch panel, and the wait time from ordering to serving was quick. The staff's energy was quite impressive, which made the dining experience enjoyable. I kept ordering the freshly prepared fish as recommendations appeared on the screen.I quickly became full, and it was my first time being able to eat so much sushi. Delicious food really does have an endless appeal.I'll definitely want to visit again when I'm in Tokyo!"
High-quality ramen,"I think I went on a weekend, and after checking in, I waited a few minutes before being seated! The sushi was, of course, delicious, but the quality of the ramen was truly impressive! The portions were just a bite or two each, but they were so tasty that I ended up ordering both the soy sauce and miso versions! The presentation of the uni was also stunningit's a conveyor sushi restaurant, but the experience was exceptional (laughs)."
Very busy weekend lunch,"Conveyor Belt Sushi & Standing Sushi in OmotesandoIt seems to be a budget version of a famous restaurant.The standing area has only 7 seats and the rotation is extremely slow. Be prepared to wait at least an hour. Even though itÅfs a standing sushi spot, there are proper seats, so it feels more like a regular sushi restaurant.You can eat as much as you like for around JPY 6000 per person.ItÅfs delicious, but the price reflects its quality.The fish is quite tasty, so I would say it's a good value for the money.However, be ready to wait for that long."
"If there's no line, I would love to go back for the 'Yama Sachi Hon Maguro'...","On this day, I was invited by my family and initially planned to brave the queues, but there was a heavy snow warning from the morning.We agreed to postpone, but the weather forecast said the snow would stop in the afternoon...I confess that I made a reckless decision to go despite the snow warning. m(._.)mFortunately, there were no consequences to this decision, and it seems someone in my family has the luck of entering the restaurant without any wait even after 12 PM, and I was able to benefit from that bliss.To add to my good fortune, my payment for the day was covered by my second daughter...I must be the lucky one here! We were guided to our table and, all together, were welcomed with a lively, ""Welcome to Onodera!"" It made me realize once again that this is indeed a kaiten sushi place.The staff explained the store's system. The tea served is the standard powdered tea found in typical kaiten sushi restaurants, but a notable difference is that we can order gari (pickled ginger) and wasabi via tablet (which is free).In our family, we usually order only what each of us wants, so having one piece per plate is quite appreciated.Å°Today's Orders  14 pieces + extras that I had:1. Yama K Hon Maguro Akami @ JPY 4202. Yama K Hon Maguro Chutoro @ JPY 6203. Homemade Stewed Anago @ JPY 6404. 2 pieces of Homemade Shime Saba @ JPY 4405. Homemade Kohada @ JPY 3406.

Homemade Castella Tamago @ JPY 290When I finished eating, I realized my biggest mistake!I forgot the winter yellowtail (Kä¶ÉuÉä) (ÅÑÅÉ)ItÅfs a major blunder not to have it during this season.ÅyYama K MaguroÅzNevertheless, the biggest selling point of ""Onodera"" is that Yama K's tuna is delicious.The akami (red meat) has a unique flavor that you typically don't experience at other kaiten sushi places, and I felt the delightful umami amidst a slight acidity (iron content).ÅyKuruma EbiÅzKuruma Ebi is quite rare in kaiten sushi restaurants. It was presented as a nigiri with the opened side facing up, which made me wonder if it was steamed shrimp by mistake.There must be a reason for this style of nigiri, but it remains unclear.Nonetheless, the flavor was undoubtedly that of Kuruma Ebi...ÅyAnagoÅzThere was plenty of simmered sauce, and everyone elseÅfs anago had double the amount compared to mine. When anago is delicious, it definitely raises the mood, but there was only stewed fish on the menu.ÅyShariÅzConsidering I had the tamagoyaki included, I felt I had about 15 pieces. The akazu (red vinegar) rice is on the smaller side, allowing for a satisfactory number of pieces. ItÅfs a clever setup.As for the other toppings, starting from shime saba, I felt I understood why Toriton is so popular as it is on the same level. I think this is where you should come when youÅfre craving tuna.ÅyStanding Sushi Ginza OnoderaÅzWhen I asked where the standing sushi shop was, they informed me itÅfs next door. However, it wasnÅft a standing-only shop; it had chairs, and it seemed to offer a better seating experience. When it's just two people, this place looks much cozier."
Top-tier Kaiten Sushi (though it hardly rotates),"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera has been a hot topic as a sushi restaurant with a unique kaiten style. I visited at around 2:30 PM on a Friday, and since it was snowing lightly in the city, I was seated in less than five minutes.The restaurant was about 90% full, with around half of the guests being international touristsit's great to see them back!The quality of the fish and rice clearly surpasses typical kaiten sushi standards. In fact, while itÅfs a kaiten sushi place, the plates arenÅft actually rotating (laughs). When it comes to quality, it rivals some of the finest sushi counters.Among the dishes I tried, I especially want to recommend the following:""Hon Maguro Chutoro"" The moment it hits your mouth, the fish melts beautifully. The appearance is stunning as well, which adds to the experience. The rice perfectly complements the chutoro.""Botan Ebi"" This had a nice firm texture and exceptional freshness. The sweetness of the shrimp was rich but not overwhelming, making it a wonderfully flavorful piece.""Meji Maguro"" I first tasted this at a high-end sushi restaurant in Sapporo about a month ago, and IÅfve been a fan ever since. It offers a different deliciousness compared to chutoro or akami,and the richness of the fat is outstanding. I highly recommend giving it a try.These were some of the highlights from my meal, but of course, the other selections were delicious as well. The rice served here is of a level you wouldn't typically find at a kaiten sushi place, and it's a pleasure to enjoy such high-quality sushi at a casual setting.I look forward to visiting again!"
Hmm...?,"The last time I ate here, the flavor was truly top-notch.This time, I was left wondering...Since I've eaten here several times over different periods, I can tell it's possibly dropped in quality a bit. For this type of establishment, itÅfs still delicious, of course.Is it really that difficult to maintain quality?I noticed there were chairs for standing dining, so maybe thatÅfs a good sign?"

Then I noticed that it's split between conveyor sushi and standing sushi. I somehow ended up going to the conveyor side. The atmosphere was lively, as you'd expect from a conveyor sushi place.The rice is seasoned with red vinegar, and the soy sauce is applied directly.

Not that surprising!,"I had some time to spare before dinner at another restaurant, so I decided to stop by here as the places are very close to each other.IÅfve been curious about this famous tuna place for a while.DidnÅft the company win the first auction for tuna this year as well?I arrived around 4:30 PM without a reservation and was seated right away!I ordered a beer, and the hand towel was nice.By registering on LINE, I got a complimentary piece of sea bream sashimi.I quickly placed my order for the Hon Maguro from Yamako.I chose the medium fatty tuna and red meat.The touch-screen ordering system is convenient and nice! My order came quite fast!Upon tasting it, I found it wasnÅft quite as surprising as I expected.It was just ordinary, really.Well, tuna is tuna, right?IÅfve had first-rate tuna plenty of times, including ones from Oma.While the sushi had a nice touch, like using red vinegar, there are certainly better places that serve tastier sushi.If I had to pick the highlight, the purple sea urchin was delicious!It was definitely better than the horse manure sea urchin I had alongside it.One good point was that the dishes came out rather quickly.The drinks were served smoothly as well.However, the final dish, the raw shirasu (whitebait), was forgotten and just sat there without being served.Also, the sake was poured on the table instead of the counter, which was frustrating.But I kept quiet because IÅfve been a bit more relaxed lately.But still, it is bound to spill anyway!The girl who poured for me filled the masu cup to the brim, but doesnÅft she realize it will overflow? Was she not trained?What a waste!!!Overall, the service was lacking! I wonder if they just cater to tourists or foreigners (*^^*)There are still plenty of restaurants that serve good sea urchin, so I probably won't come back here.ItÅfs pricey too.Sorry about that! (^o^)/"
Delicious! Yamazaki Tuna and everything else is tasty too.,"It was wonderful.The tuna from Yamako was exceptional, and I thoroughly enjoyed the house-made sushi from Onodera and all the other toppings.I had:Yamako's Hon Maguro O-toroYamako's Hon Maguro Chu-toroYamako's Hon Maguro AkamiYamako's Hon Maguro Akami-zukeYamako's Hon Maguro Nakaochi GunkanYamako's Hon Maguro Tekka MakiHouse-made Stewed AnagoHouse-made Shime SabaAnd much more."
Thick and juicy,"I had lunch with my sister in Omotesando at a kaiten sushi place I had been curious about for a while. Leaving my older siblings, who have a different sense of money due to chain restaurants, we visited with just adults and a baby.When we arrived on a weekday at 11 AM, there was already a line. It seems they open at 10:30 AM, but the restaurant was completely packed. Everyone must be having breakfast here.Initially, we managed to slip in as the third group, but more customers kept arriving afterward. During busy times, there seems to be a 90-minute limit, so turnover is not too bad.In addition to counter seating, there are box seats, which we aimed for this time since we had kids with us. There were also private rooms further back in the restaurant. I wonder if reservations can be made.We were seated about 15 minutes later, right around lunchtime.We ordered the day's recommendations and focused on tuna.With the registration as a LINE friend, we received a complimentary piece, which was a Spanish mackerel that day.ÅöCold Sea BreamSeared EngawaÅöAmberjackÅöFreshly Caught Striped JackCold FlounderNakaochi GunkanTekka MakiToro-Taku MakiÅö dishes marked were particularly delicious. Seasonal ingredients seemed to have the upper hand over tuna this time.Each piece was thick, allowing us to enjoy the sweetness from the texture. The Engawa was plump and searing it made the fat ooze out juicily. It was rich without being overly greasy, showcasing excellent quality.The Cold Sea Bream had substantial thickness and robust sweetness.The Striped Jack had a clean sweetness, with consistent flesh density. The Flounder was thick and it had a pleasantly soft elasticitynot tough, but rather cushiony, enhancing its sweetness. The Nakaochi had plenty as well, with the melting tuna fat giving a smooth mouthfeel. It had ample sweetness and paired well with soy sauce.Compared to other offerings, the Tekka was slightly less impressive in terms of the fish.The Toro-Taku Maki was delicious with its melting fat, but I felt it could have been a bit more fulfilling.There were also high-priced sushi pieces ranging from JPY 750 to JPY 1,200 each, but for our first time, we opted for the more affordable options. I was so impressed by the thickness of the nigiri rather than the gunkan or rolls, that I think I will try some fatty cuts or medium fatty tuna next time. IÅfll have to come back early again."

"From Ginza to the world, and casual dining spots you can easily visit.","Just a 5-minute walk from Omotesando.You enter a side street across from the Apple store, where you can find a crowd. I'm currently on a restricted diet, but I can't resist sushi. I've been interested in this place for a long time, and after a year, I decided to check it out as the crowd seemed to have thinned out.When I arrived around 6 PM, there were 40 groups ahead of me... I was quite anxious about whether I would get in before closing. It was a numbered system, so I took a number and waited. You can get tickets for both standing sushi and the conveyor belt, so I reserved both (but just to clarify, itÅfs neither conveyor nor standing). After spending 2 hours outside, I finally entered.While waiting inside, they were having an event featuring sea bream. I asked a staff member if it was still available, and they confidently said it was definitely fine, but by the time I sat down, they were sold out.First up was the first catch of tuna. It was simply delicious.Mackerel. Quite good.Toro-taku. Amazing.Seared salmon. Average.Shirako (cod milt). Exquisite.Kawahagi (filefish). Exquisite.Akaika (squid). Average.Anago (conger eel, which I forgot to mention). Absolutely delicious.By around 8 PM, many items were sold out, so I couldn't have everything I wanted, but overall the fish was fresh and of good quality. The red vinegar rice was also just the right hardness; I wasn't expecting it to be warm.It's easy to see why itÅfs popular.Considering the price range, I thought that even if I were to go to another sushi place in Ginza, I would choose Onodera at this location.This is the tricky part about dining with a group, but I was very satisfied.Aside from the announcements from the staff and the casual demeanor of the sushi chef who served me, I would rank this as the number one conveyor belt sushi place.IÅfll be back!"
Sushi Dinner at Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in Omotesando,"I tried the 'Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera' in Omotesando after enjoying the delicious 'Ginza Onodera Trymon' I mentioned earlier. Since it was just after New Year, I thought I might get some auspicious items as it was the time when Onodera had just won the most tuna at the auctions.The exterior of the restaurant is conveniently located just across from Apple, a short walk from Omotesando Station.There was a signboard celebrating the best tuna.Given it was a weekend night along with the slight easing of inbound travel restrictions, the place was very crowded, and I ended up waiting for about 1.5 hours. I later realized that I could have made a reservation through EPARK, but by the time I noticed, that dayÅfs slots had already been filled.The interior had a dazzling atmosphere, offering a completely different vibe compared to Trymon.Ordering was done via a touch panel, and the chefs directly served the plates. Since the conveyor belt wasn't moving at all, it technically wasn't a true conveyor belt sushi experience. HereÅfs what I ordered:- Freshly auctioned tuna (akami and toro) for JPY 1040. I enjoyed my first taste of the season, limited to one plate per person.- Live-caught Kanpachi for JPY 540. It had a rich fat content but a firm texture.- Hirame (flounder) for JPY 620. I believe it was part of a limited-time offer announced in the restaurant.- Engawa (flounder fin) for JPY 440. It's one of my personal favorites, although itÅfs not cheap, and I expected it to be flounder rather than a flatfish.- Crab-flavored salad gunkan for JPY 230. A personal favorite of mine. It might be considered a kids' menu item, and they probably don't make the salad on-site, though.- Fresh salmon gunkan for JPY 420. I donÅft recall it making a strong impression.- Fresh sardine for JPY 450. Despite being a blue fish, it was surprisingly fatty and tender.- Homemade marinated mackerel rolled with kombu for JPY 640. I wasnÅft too sure about this one.- Special natto maki for JPY 290. It came topped with plum and bonito flakes, allowing for three different tastes.- Anago cucumber maki for JPY 640. The cucumber was perfectly textured.- Kappa maki for JPY 280. Although it was just a kappa maki, the cucumber was finely sliced, making it quite different from the usual version.Overall, the quality and taste of the sushi and toppings were impressive. However, I did notice that the rice was cold and somewhat compacted, which was a bit concerning. I couldn't discern if they used the same ingredients as Trymon, but I missed the warm, fluffy texture of the rice that breaks apart nicely in your mouth.The prices were on the higher side, and while I think itÅfs undoubtedly delicious for a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, I was expecting a taste closer to Trymon's, which left me with slightly different expectations."

Thus, we established ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch"" in Omotesando in October 2021.The tuna served here comes from the famous wholesale provider ""Yama Ko"" in Toyosu. All the ingredients are prepared in-house, featuring intricate knife techniques that reflect the craftsmanship of Edo-style sushi.While it follows the kaiten (conveyor belt) style, the only items that circle around are the recommended dishes. All sushi is crafted by skilled chefs right in front of you after you place your order, providing a live cooking experience.Ordering is done through a touch panel, allowing you to adjust settings such as smaller rice portions or removing green onions.The mildly tangy rice, seasoned with red vinegar, pairs perfectly with the thick slices of Yama Ko's tuna.It was a great meal.Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[Å[ÅyYama Ko Hon Maguro ChutoroÅz JPY 620ÅyYama Ko Hon Maguro AkamiÅz JPY 420ÅyYama Ko Hon Maguro Akami ZukeÅz JPY 510ÅyYama Ko Hon Maguro Nakaochi Gunkan (2 pieces)Åz JPY 620ÅyYama Ko Hon Maguro Tekka Hosomaki (1 roll)Åz JPY 510Total: JPY 2680"
Delicious sushi that's easy to enjoy in Omotesando,"As I was running errands in Omotesando, it started to get dark, and I thought it was about time for dinner. That's when I noticed this place. ItÅfs quite a famous sushi restaurant; I had seen it featured on TV when it first opened, and I had been curious about it for a while. Being a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, it seemed easy to grab just a few plates, which is perfect for someone like me who doesnÅft eat a large quantity. I quickly went inside and took a waiting card. Since I arrived a bit earlier, there was only one group ahead of me, and I got seated right away. The counter is arranged in a circle around the sushi chefs, and the ceiling is lined with round light bulbs that resemble those seen on squid fishing boats from the past. The seating is a bit snug, and I could see myself hesitating if the number of plates increased. I used the green tea powder and hot water system available at the table to make my tea. Ordering is done through a touch panel. I took my time browsing the menu, considering todayÅfs recommendations along with some tuna. I selected shimesaba (vinegared mackerel) and buri (yellowtail) from the recommendations. It seems they are particularly proud of their tuna, sourced from high-end suppliers. I also decided to try the negitoro (minced tuna with green onion) since I was there. The shimesaba was marinated in a pleasantly tangy vinegar. It tasted great, with just the right balance, so much so that I debated whether to add soy sauce or not, given the nice vinegary flavor. The buri was incredibly fresh and had a great texture. Thanks to the finely executed knife work, the firm sashimi was easy to chew and enjoy. The tuna had a rich flavor with a hint of sweetness that stood out. There was none of that watery texture you might find in thawed fish; the tender pieces, carefully sliced, paired excellently with soy sauce. I typically donÅft eat that much, and since each piece was fulfilling, I left satisfied. It was a great meal!"
Authentic Red Rice Kaiten Sushi: Exceptional location and atmosphere! An entertainment-style sushi restaurant that transcends traditional conveyor belt sushi.,"On December 12, 2022, the kanji character representing the state of the nation for the year was decided to be ""War."" Out of approximately 220,000 total votes, ""War"" received 10,804 votes. I wonder if there's any meaning to this tradition we do every year? Well, as long as everyone enjoys it, I'm happy. Hello! The only thing on my mind every day is ""Food,"" this is Takumon  Today, I'm heading to Åy[âÙì]ÈΩ ã‚ç¿Ç®ÇÃÇ≈ÇÁ ñ{ìX](https://onodera-group.com/kaitensushi-ginza/)Åz. It's about a 3-minute walk from Omotesando Station. A1 exit is nearby. Opened in October 2021. Our goal is to be ""the most exciting and enjoyable sushi restaurant in Japan."" We wanted to bring the quality cultivated in ""[ÈΩ ã‚ç¿ Ç®ÇÃÇ≈ÇÁ](13153824)"" to a wider audience, so you can enjoy Åggenuine Edomae sushiÅh in a kaiten sushi style. I visited on a weekend afternoon. At first, I planned to quickly investigate a sushi restaurant near Harajuku that has been featured in commercials. However, to my surprise, there was a 140-minute wait. No way, that's over the top! Is it really that popular? I haven't been there yet... I guess I'll go on a weekday instead. So, I became a sushi refugee. But I was already fully set on sushi, so I consulted a foodie friend. They gave me several recommendations. Thank you, Oligosaccharide (ÅLÅÕÅM*) It's nearby, so I decided to check this place out. Is this the famous Ginza Onodera? Seriously? Sounds great! Oh, I cross the signal in front of [Apple Omotesando](https://www.apple.com/jp/retail/omotesando/) to get to a narrow path. Easy to find. By the way, I can't even buy the latest iPhone in a store yet...? The exterior of Onodera is lovely. The lighting is stylish. Standing sushi? Wait, it's standing to eat? I was shocked by the sign outside, but once I peeked inside, people were seated. Phew. Thank goodness. There seems to be standing areas, but there are also box tables and private rooms. That's a relief. There were no guests waiting outside. It seems like heading there early on weekends is a good idea. Inside, there were a few customers waiting. First, I registered the number of people using the ""waiting ticket machine"" near the entrance. I pressed the button. This setup is becoming quite common these days. What's nice is that you donÅft have to wait there the whole time. By registering your phone number, you'll be notified when your turn is approaching. Oh, this is nice! So, I entered my number. But it looks like I can wait in the seating area, so I decided to sit down. Just as I sat down, the phone rang. From 050-8882-ÅõÅõÅõÅõ. Hello? Who is this? Hello? Santa? After a while, a robotic voice said, ""Your turn is coming up soon."" ThereÅfs a bit of a delay, but itÅfs quite efficient, though it ended up being meaningless lol A few minutes later, I was shown to my seat. Wow, inside is a large U-shaped counter. There are chefs in the center. ItÅfs beautiful and has a cool vibe unique to Omotesando with the sparkling ceiling. The seating is simple and quite nice. I order via a touchpad. During checkout, IÅfll bring the blue number plate to the register. ItÅfs kaiten sushi, so thereÅfs a conveyor belt, but the sushi toppings arenÅft rotating. Only plates with writing are going around. Hmm, this is fine, but it feels a bit lonely. Opinions might differ on this, but personally, I don't mind it not moving. Given the times weÅfre in... that just makes it an ordinary sushi restaurant, haha. The tea is served with a ladle. The taste is consistent and delicious, and the water temperature isnÅft too hot. ThereÅfs Wi-Fi. The restrooms are separate for men and women, clean, and functional.  What I had today (selected items): - Åy[Ç‚Ç‹çK ñ{É}ÉOÉçëÂÉgÉç](b)Åz930Right off the bat, what a dynamite choice! (Laughs)Being able to eat tuna from Yamako is seriously impressive.It comes pre-seasoned, no soy sauce needed.It practically vanished in my mouth the moment I took a bite.So delicious! The sushi rice is made with red vinegar.ItÅfs rare to find red vinegar at kaiten sushi places.They offer different portion sizes, but the standard size felt a bit small. The real tuna from Yamako seems to be quite popular and sells out quickly, so it's recommended to order early. - Åy[ê^Ç¢ÇÌÇµ](b)Åz420So good. For two pieces at this price, itÅfs quite reasonable.The portion size is also decent. I thought about ordering another but it was already sold out... I can see why itÅfs popular. - Åy[äàÅYÇ©ÇÒÇœÇø](b)Åz510I love Kanpachi! It's called Kanpachi, not Kan Nan Nan. ItÅfs great that the careful knife technique enhances the texture. ItÅfs fresh and has a nice crunch. - Åy [ë◊ìl ñ≥‡hâﬂê∂å¥é èÉïƒé](b)Åz830I want to highlight this one. When I ordered a sake just to drink, the staff came to me and said, ""Would you like some cheers?"" ""Uh, okay, sure,"" I said without really knowing why.And to my surprise, they poured directly from a one-sho bottle into a masu. ""Yes, letÅfs go! More! ThatÅfs right, more!!"" The enthusiasm echoed throughout the restaurant. Plus, the conveyor belt stopped during that time. Wow, this is a great service. I even filmed it in action mode in 4K. But everyone around was watching, and as a shy person, I felt a little embarrassed... Just kidding!! Maybe I should order another glass? (ÅLÅÕÅM) Haha! But it seemed like the other customers werenÅft ordering much? WhatÅfs going on?Åc But, this is a good service! By the way, they also have Juyondai sake. Also, the selection of wines and other alcohol is plentiful. Great for someone like me who loves to drink. The most expensive item is 120,000? I wonder if there are secret menu items... To finish, I slurped up some salt-flavored ramen. It was a small serving, just a bite. Wow, OnoderaÅfs ramen is quite interesting. ItÅfs a common menu item at kaiten sushi places, but it was really tasty. I ordered this, and when I checked the menu, it was already sold out. Since the seating is limited to 90 minutes, I headed to pay about that time. I was pleasantly surprised that it was cheaper than I had imagined! Considering we were drinking and eating, the price was quite reasonable. By the time we left, there were already plenty of waiting customers outside. Kaiten sushi... It seems like this place would appeal to both Japanese and foreigners. You can feel the hospitality, and the taste is superb. I left satisfied and enjoyed my time. Now, let's buy some dessert on the way home... Thank you for the meal!"

Delicious sushi spot perfect for solo female diners,"I had been curious about this place for a long time and finally got to visit it.In Tokyo, there are many high-end sushi restaurants, and it felt rather daunting to go to such a place alone, so I chose this restaurant instead.Since it was my first visit, I invited a friend to join me.I found it to be a great value with delicious food and a place I could comfortably visit alone.The sushi was genuinely tasty, and I really enjoyed it!I will definitely be back."
A restaurant that delivers high satisfaction,"Needless to say, itÅfs Onodera's kaiten sushi.(IÅfm not quite sure about the difference between âÙì] and âÒì].)I visit quite frequently when I go to Omotesando or Harajuku.Of course, itÅfs different from the main branch of Onodera, but isn't it good enough? You can casually grab a bite and enjoy a drink for around JPY 5000.If you skip the drinks, I think you could keep it under JPY 3000.You can even make reservations through your smartphone, so I highly recommend it in that area.It was delicious. It was a great meal."
Enjoy high-end sushi in Ginza at a reasonable price!,"Located in Omotesando, Onodera is a branch of a famous sushi restaurant in Ginza.Enjoying a kaiten sushi style, it's more budget-friendly than the original in Ginza.I arrived a bit earlier than dinner time, and the place was already bustling with customers! I waited about 30 minutes before being seated.Using a touchscreen, I could order my favorite sushi, and everything looked delicious.From the firm texture of white fish to the rich, oily Kinmedai (which is splendid!), and the fluffy Anago, it truly felt like a high-end experience, far beyond what you'd expect from kaiten sushi!My favorite Toro-Taku hand rolls were crispy with nori, and they were incredibly tasty too.I had around 7 plates, and it cost me about JPY 6000, so I was really impressed with the cost performance!"
Quick bite after work,"In November 2022, it was ""Good Meat Day,"" but I was in the mood for sushi, so I headed to Onodera.I could have made a reservation through EPARK, but since there was no wait, I walked in without one.The place looked about half full.What I ordered:Shima Aji (Japanese Horse Mackerel)Chutoro (Medium Fatty Tuna)Salmon Harami (Salmon Belly)House-made Pickled Mackerel Wrapped in KombuThe Shima Aji was flavorful and delicious! For some reason, only one side was sliced, but since itÅfs a firmer fish, having it properly cut would make it easier to eat.The Chutoro was also very tasty, living up to the restaurantÅfs reputation for excellent tuna!The Salmon Harami had a nice amount of fat, and the large piece was very enjoyable.The house-made Pickled Mackerel wrapped in kombu had a bit of a fishy taste lingering.I noticed a slight fishy odor when I tried the tempura eel here previously, so they may not be great at handling fish that tends to have a stronger smell.Since I kept it light, my bill came to just over JPY 2000.I love Shima Aji, so I definitely want to come back!"
Neither here nor there,"I've been curious about this high-end conveyor belt sushi for a while now.I visited on a holiday evening, and perhaps because it was off-peak or rainy, the place was quite empty.I headed to the conveyor belt sushi section and placed my order via the touchscreen. While tuna seems to be their specialty, I was intrigued by the lean cuts, so I decided to try the marinated sushi and tuna rolls.They were decent enough.I also ordered bonito, octopus, mackerel, and engawa (flounder fin). Honestly...sushi of this kind might be better enjoyed one piece at a time rather than two.The shari (sushi rice) was a bit hard, and although the ingredients were well-prepared, it didnÅft quite leave me shouting ÅedeliciousÅf as a sushi experience.However, it might be a nice choice when you want to indulge yourself a bit."
Prefer standing sushi over conveyor belt,"The standing sushi and the kaiten sushi are separated. I was immediately drawn to the standing option, and it turned out to be a fantastic choice. After enjoying a hearty meal there, I moved on to the kaiten section, which had some unique offerings and the prices seemed about half.Entering the small alleyway with the Kabukiza Theatre behind me, I could see the Kabukiza straight aheadsuch a beloved view in the heart of Ginza. This is where the renowned Onodera is located. Since they used to occupy the same building, I often visited here.With kaiten sushi, the show begins. The chef performs with a giant octopus leg, using a microphoneitÅfs quite entertaining. I tried several items that are exclusive to the kaiten section; the anago (saltwater eel) was completely different from what I had at the standing sushi. While the sourcing was excellent, the initial preparation could use some work, as it had a slimy texture, and the seasoning felt commercially made.The kombu rolls, bonito, seared engawa, tamago (egg), and salad rolls were decent, though the price to value ratio wasn't great. If you're going to eat kaiten sushi, I'd recommend sticking to the fatty tuna.You should definitely head to the counter. Although it's called standing sushi, you can actually sit down, and the quality of ingredients is superb, which is unexpected for standing sushi. As expected of Onodera, they source top-quality fish. The standing sushi here is likely among the best in the country. Even without the Onodera brand, this quality at such a price is impressive."
Yamakou Hon Maguro at Kaiten Sushi,"Wait time was about 10 minutes, totaling JPY 20,200.I learned that I could enjoy Yamako's authentic tuna at a kaiten sushi restaurant, so I visited without a reservation during my trip to Tokyo. Luckily, I was seated in about 10 minutes.I ordered red meat tuna and bonito using the touch panel, along with a draft beer.The place was fully booked, so I prepared for a bit of a wait, and while the draft beer arrived first, I had to wait almost 10 minutes for the red meat tuna and bonito.As for the taste, the tuna sourced from Yamako was exceptional.After that, I ordered some fried squid and fried tentacles as appetizers, along with two more draft beers.Feeling completely satisfied, I settled the bill and headed to Ginza."
Great value for a quick bite during certain hours,"I visited on a weekday evening.I was able to walk in without any wait, and the taste was delicious, making it feel like a superior version of Sushizanmai.It tends to get quite crowded on weekends.While it is certainly pricier than typical conveyor belt sushi, the quality is comparable to high-end restaurants.The fatty tuna (toro) was especially tasty.It's a great place to casually visit, with good taste and value for money."
Sushi at Onodera for less than half price?!,"Ginza's famous sushi restaurant, Onodera, has opened a budget-friendly kaiten sushi shop in Omotesando.They use tuna from Yamako, and at the first auction, both Yamako and Onodera's parent company, LEOC, secured some fish.While it may not be as cheap as chain restaurants, you can enjoy it for less than half the price of Ginza Onodera.The quality of the ingredients might be slightly lower, but both the toppings and rice are excellent!Personally, I believe the boundary between high-end and budget sushi places is a simple matter of whether the soy sauce is served on the side or pre-applied.Our total for two came to exactly JPY 10,000.We ordered through a touchscreen panel and didnÅft have to wait long for our dishes to arrive.I made a reservation via the booking site 15 minutes before opening at 11 AM, and when I took the train to the restaurant, I was seated within just 5 minutes."
A sushi restaurant that's easy to visit alone in the city,"I entered around 15:30 on a weekday.After checking in at the machine by the entrance, I was promptly seated.I noticed several other customers dining alone as well.What I ordered:Draft beer (glass) JPY 470Yama Ko Hon-Maguro Akami (tuna red meat) 1 piece JPY 420 ÅùYama Ko Hon-Maguro Nakaochi (tuna belly) 2 pieces JPY 620Cod milt gunkan (sushi) 2 pieces JPY 620Homemade Shime-Saba (marinated mackerel) 2 pieces JPY 420 ÅùHandmade Ikura (salmon roe) soy sauce gunkan 2 pieces JPY 510Ultimate uni (sea urchin) tasting 2 pieces JPY 1800Sawara (free service for LINE friends on weekdays)Å® Total bill JPY 4860Personally, I really enjoyed the Yama Ko Hon-Maguro Akami and the Homemade Shime-Saba! The Akami was rich and packed with flavor, while the Shime-Saba was perfectly balanced, not too sour and full of fat.I wished I could have tried more, but I had to restrain myself due to budget constraints.It was delicious, but it felt somewhat pricey, maybe due to the location.I'd have liked to know which type of uni was served during the tasting."
A mix of gems and stones,"It had been a while since I visited Omotesando, and I thought about stopping by Shirou for some soba, but it turns out they're closed on Wednesdays. My apologies for that.So, I quickly searched for a nearby spot and ended up here.On a weekday at around 7 PM, the restaurant was about 60-70% full. It felt like there were quite a few foreign patrons and younger customers, likely due to the location.Now, what I had included:Seasonal TempuraBelly TunaSquidOctopusAosa Seaweed SoupSteamed ShrimpSalmon RoeToro-Taku, and more.I received a free Engawa (flounder fin) as a service when I sent a friend request on LINE.There was also a time-limited promotion offering Nakaochi (the fatty part from the collar of the fish) at a discount.Overall, while the good dishes were quite delicious, some were disappointing. Price doesnÅft seem to matter much here. The relatively inexpensive items on the menu, like squid and octopus, were not bad, while the tempura had a decent batter, but the ingredients felt a bit soggy.It was a bit of a shame, but this place seems like it could significantly improve with just a few changes. I think IÅfll keep an eye on it for now."
Delicious Chutoro,"I visited on Sunday afternoon. You can make a reservation via smartphone. For some reason, I was called even though it wasn't my turn, but the staff handled it very politely. The atmosphere is bright and welcoming. When I ordered Japanese sake, the staff poured it while calling out, so it felt like a lively place. Today's menu included:Medium fatty tunaFatty tunaShimada fishSea urchinGrilled engawaEggEverything was delicious and melted in my mouth. Since it was quite tasty, the prices are a bit high. I only had a light meal as I had plans for dinner elsewhere, but if you want to eat your fill, you'll likely spend double the amount. They also have some excellent wine. I would love to pair it with drinks when I visit in the evening!"
Kaiten Sushi at Ginza Onodera,"I've finally visited a restaurant I've wanted to go to since it opened. I arrived early in the evening and was able to enter without waiting.Upon entering, there was a large counter and some tables in the back.As expected from Onodera, I was surprised to find a selection of high-end wines. This place is on a different level compared to regular kaiten sushi.Although it's a kaiten sushi, due to the pandemic, they had a system to order your dishes. All orders were made using the touch panel right in front of me.I had some appetizers and fried octopus, along with several pieces of sushi.As for the sushi, I wonder if I had set my expectations too high? I didn't feel much difference in satisfaction compared to chain sushi places I've been to.Maybe I could just go to a sushi restaurant in Tsukiji instead.Something about it didnÅft quite click, so I'd like to give it another try."
Happy 1st Anniversary!,"I've been going to the Kaiten Sushi at Omotesando lately, so I made a lunch reservation at the Ginza flagship store for next Saturday (^ ^).I discovered on Twitter that Onodera is holding a 1st-anniversary event from the 7th to the 10th!!Come to think of it, I first heard about the opening last October.I thought it was quite a feat to open during the pandemic, but theyÅfve been operating continuously,I finally visited for the first time this year, and today is my fourth visit.IÅfm excited to enjoy the sushi again after a long time (ÅOÅûÅO).The prices for nigiri have become more reasonable, and [b: the draft beer is half price!!]I wish Onodera would advertise more ( É÷ ).So, IÅfve changed my plans last minute and decided to go to Kaiten Sushi Onodera!!I woke up early and took a 1.5-hour walk as a pre-meal workout!!As I sneak through the stylish Omotesando, a not-so-flashy old guy like me is moving Åc There are so many cute people here (ÅVÉ÷ÅV).ItÅfs just a short walk from Omotesando Station, which is great.Even though I arrived right after the opening, itÅfs the 1st anniversary, so the place is pretty crowded (Å@ﬂÑtﬂ).As always, the staff kindly guided me to my seat.I learned that when entering from the right side, the staff will push your chair in for you (ÅP ÅP).But I still moved the chair myselfitÅfs just too embarrassing (ÅVÉ÷ÅV)(ÅVÉ÷ÅV)(ÅVÉ÷ÅV).I couldnÅft chat much with the itamae (sushi chef) since they were busy, but thatÅfs understandable (o^^o).Looking at the touch panel, it indeed shows that nigiri is a bit cheaper now.The menu has also expanded compared to before. The beer is half price as advertised!! Good good d(ÅP ÅP).The price for Dom Perignon remains the same É∞(ÅPÅBÅP…)….Today's tuna is from Toy in Hokkaido.

I thought on my way home, but perhaps because I exercised a bit too much in the morning,I noticed I felt a bit warm on my way back. It might have been just the right time to leave (^ ^).I started to tell myself, ""YouÅfve been drinking too much this early in the day"" (  ).I enjoyed plenty of beer and sushi for just over JPY 7,000.IÅfll definitely make this a regular spot ( o )/I canÅft wait for next Saturday.

[Delicious Tuna] Onodera's Challenge Kaiten Sushi,"Our restaurant, Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, opened in Omotesando in 2021 as part of the famous sushi chain ""Onodera"" in Ginza. Visiting on a Sunday around 2 PM, we had to wait for about 30 minutes with 8 groups ahead of us, showing its popularity.The interior was surprisingly stylish for a conveyor belt sushi place, featuring both counter and box seating that made it quite accommodating.ÅöÅyYama Katsu Hon Tuna Akami (1 piece) JPY 420ÅzÅyYama Katsu Hon Tuna O toro (1 piece) JPY 930ÅzÅyLive Hokkigai JPY 840ÅzÅöÅySanma JPY 620ÅzÅyMadai JPY 420ÅzÅyFresh Salmon JPY 420ÅzÅyFresh Salmon Harami (1 piece) JPY 320ÅzÅyKampyo Maki JPY 320ÅzÅySpecial Natto Maki JPY 280ÅzIt's rare to find conveyor belt sushi with red vinegar rice!

The ÅyO toroÅz was tasty but seemed a bit dry, likely because it was freshly thawedperhaps we just hit a bad timing (sweat).Considering the price, I feel there are options available at casual sushi restaurants rather than just conveyor belt sushi. Personally, I love that I can casually enjoy ""Yama Katsu's tuna"" here. It was a great meal! "
High-End Sushi without the Conveyor Belt,"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera has its main branch in Ginza, and it's known for its standing sushi and kaiten sushi restaurants. I've heard a lot about it for a while and have been curious, but I hadn't had the chance to visit until now, and finally made it to this kaiten sushi.This restaurant doesn't accept reservations, and due to its immense popularity, you must wait in line on weekends. However, they do distribute numbered tickets and provide estimated wait times, so the stress of waiting is minimized. Located right next to Omotesando, you can enjoy some window shopping while passing the time.I got a numbered ticket before noon and was seated in about 30 minutes.After pedaling for an hour on my bicycle, I was really hungry, feeling like my stomach would touch my back. Since IÅfd be cycling a lot today, I wouldn't gain any weight no matter how much I ate.I came with three friends, and we ordered a variety of dishes, so I'll share a digest version. IÅfve left longer comments on the items that stood out to me. Prices range from around JPY 300 for the cheaper plates to about JPY 800 for the more expensive ones. If you eat without worrying about the cost, you can expect to eat approximately 12-13 plates, bringing the total to about JPY 8,000 per person.By the way, although the name includes ""kaiten"" (rotating), there are no sushi plates rotating in the restaurant. You order via a tablet, and the staff directly serves the sushi over the counter. Honestly, even if the sushi was rotating, I wouldnÅft take from it, so this style works just fine for me.Boiled shrimp. This was quite ordinary.Yamako's tuna (akami). As expected from Yamako, the fish itself is delicious. However, you can see that the quality of the preparation is just average. They might be training disciples while running the business. The use of red vinegar while serving is definitely exciting.Buri (yellowtail).Kanpachi. The fat content was great, showcasing the high quality of the ingredient itself.Sea bream.Horse mackerel. It had no unpleasant smell and was a reliably tasty aji. I indeed prefer blue fish.Grilled salmon. The piece was large, with good marbling, delivering an understandable deliciousness. I started to realize that enjoying flavors mainly comes from such substantial ingredients rather than intricate techniques.A gunkan (battleship-style sushi) overflowing with ikura (salmon roe), it offered a direct approach with the raw ingredients. The quality of the roe was nice, making it a simply delicious dish.Tekka maki (tuna rolls). This was excellent! Compared to other items, it felt relatively cheaper, making it quite appealing. The rolled sushi here is a great deal.Sweet shrimp. This was a huge win, as three large sweet shrimp were served. The unique texture of the sweet shrimp together with the red vinegar rice was superb, and the flavor of the shrimp lingered pleasantly in my mouth after swallowing. Personally, I love Sushiro, but this cannot be compared with the tiny pieces from the hundred-yen sushi (which is natural).Grilled kinmedai (fatty sea bream). This presentation is a rarity at a sushi shop, but it was another success. Kinmedai is often associated with stewing, but since itÅfs a very delicious fish, grilling is my favorite way to enjoy it. However, the quality of the preparation definitely differs depending on the ingredient, so there are some good chefs here. Seasonal ingredients that require such care are likely prepared by skilled artisans.White shrimp. Another hit! A generous serving of flavorful white shrimp was piled on the rice.To finish, we had nodoguro (black throat sea perch). It was extremely delicious, but I couldnÅft help but compare it to the nodoguro I had recently at Sushi Ju, which was just too good.It was a great meal. I donÅft think this is a place that wins with intricate techniques; rather, it competes based on the quality of the ingredients and their size, accompanied by bold and straightforward flavors. Although the initial menu had a number of questionable items for the price, I was glad that I met some good ingredients toward the end.That said, if asked about cost performance, I would raise some doubts. Nowadays, you can enjoy quite high-quality sushi for under JPY 10,000 in the city for lunch. Considering itÅfs located in a prime area of Omotesando, some price justification is understandable, but itÅfs best to approach this restaurant with the mindset of indulging in large portions of sushi."
High-End Kaiten Sushi,"I went to Harajuku this morning to buy a watch I had been excited about, but it seemed there was no new stock today, so I was disappointed. I was feeling like my trip to Harajuku was pointless when I remembered this place I saw on Instagram and decided to stop by.It's a high-end conveyor belt sushi restaurant. I had been curious about it since I saw it on TV a while back.The atmosphere inside is lively, but considering the current situation, I think it would be better not to be too loud. It felt a bit like they were overly excited among themselves, which left me feeling uneasy.ÅöVisit DateÅöSeptember 29, 2022 (Thursday) / Just after 11 AMÅöPurposeÅöA solo early lunchÅöOrder SummaryÅöCastella Egg (JPY 280)Sweet Shrimp (1 piece) (JPY 320)Shoyu Ramen (JPY 350)Maguro Akami (1 piece) (JPY 420)Katsuobushi with Seasoned Vegetables (JPY 550)And moreÅöTime from Ordering to ServingÅöImmediateÅöFood ReviewÅöConsidering it's a high-end sushi conveyor belt restaurant, I was prepared for a relatively high price point, but it was still quite expensive after all. There are quite a few items priced individually. I ordered the Castella Egg as it was highly recommended, but it was more on the dessert side, and I preferred a regular thick omelet instead. I wasn't sure if it's meant to be a side dish or a dessert, so I just ate it during my meal.The bonito and tuna, which are two of my favorites, were delicious. However, I realized that if I kept ordering, my solo lunch bill might get out of hand, so I ordered ramen to balance things out. I had low expectations for ramen at a conveyor belt sushi place, but it turned out to be as good as recommended.ÅöRecommendation Point!!ÅöThey offer coupons if you register on LINE.I couldn't help but think that if I worked a little harder, I could afford a delicious non-conveyor belt sushi lunch. I guess that's the mindset of someone on a budget.After this, I plan to stop by a famous daifuku shop."
A welcoming kaiten sushi restaurant where you can enjoy authentic flavors.,"I visited a top-notch Edomae sushi restaurant in Ginza, now accessible at a reasonable price in Omotesando, thanks to a friend's recommendation on a weekday evening.Walking along the main street of Omotesando towards Aoyama-dori, you'll find the restaurant right after turning into the street between ""HUGO BOSS"" and ""COACH.""""Ginza Onodera,"" which aims to convey refined Japanese culture to the world through its cuisine, opened a branch in Omotesando last October.While just hearing ""Ginza"" often evokes a sense of prestige, ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" offers a friendly kaiten sushi style that appeals to everyone, especially younger customers.Given its location in an upscale area, the restaurant has a calm and sophisticated atmosphere, with prices slightly above the average kaiten sushi.However, it remains easy to enjoy high-quality Edomae sushi at a reasonable price, making it a convenient choice for many.Although itÅfs called kaiten sushi, only the menu signs are revolving. You place your orders using the panels set at your table.There are counter and table seats. Since we were a party of four, we opted for a table, but it was bustling and likely to fill up by 6 PM.The bright and clean interior creates a comfortable and tranquil ambiance.The red vinegar sushi rice and generous toppings make each piece exceptionally delicious. The authentic tuna from ""Yama Ko"" in Toyosu features a medium fatty tuna (2 pieces for JPY 620) and lean tuna (JPY 420). The homemade fish broth is also exquisite.Åö The daily special sushi today featured kampachi, bonito, and shimaaji.Åö Aburi nodoguro, medium fatty tuna, engawa, salmon, scallop, sea urchin, akagai, shime saba, and toro-taku rolls were promptly served as we continued to order.I requested smaller sushi rice portions, which allowed me to savor the fresh flavors of each topping.It was a great meal."
Enjoying Onodera's sushi for breakfast,"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera for sushi in Ginza?I didn't have high expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised! They open at 10:30 AM, so I decided to skip breakfast and check it out. The tuna was great, and the Nakaochi was delicious. Everything I ordered was fantastic. The Toro-Taku roll was easy to eat, and the fresh scallops were definitely worth a repeat visit.I was also impressed to see a beautiful woman sitting at the counter by herself, enjoying a drinkhow cool! Initially, I thought that for conveyor sushi, Mitori Sushi would be a better choice. However, this place has its own unique character and offers a wonderful experience. The female sushi chef did an excellent job as well.If I had to point out a downside, I would say the cleanliness could use a little improvement. The monitor and the area behind it were a bit dirty in the morning. Nonetheless, the service was good, and the food was excellent, so I definitely want to return. It's perfect for those days when you want to treat yourself a little."
"Delicious, though not quite the same as the original location","I've been wanting to try this place ever since I enjoyed my previous visit to Onodera in Ginza. It's just a short walk from Omotesando Station Exit A1. I arrived around 11:30 and managed to get a seat without waiting, but the restaurant was soon packed and there was a line shortly after.HereÅfs what I ordered:- Kohada (Gizzard Shad)- Aji (Mackerel)- Shime Saba (Marinated Mackerel)- Engawa (Flounder Fin) with Salt- Ikura (Salmon Roe)- Suzik (Salmon Roe)- Chtoro (Medium Fatty Tuna)- Katsuo (Bonito)- Nakaochi Gunkan (Collar Meat Gunkan)- Tempura of Tako (Octopus)- Anago (Sea Eel)- Toro-taku (Fatty Tuna and Cucumber Roll)- Tamago (Egg)The Chtoro from Yamakazu lived up to its reputation for being incredibly tasty. The Nakaochi Gunkan and Toro-taku roll were also delicious.The Engawa was impressively large, overflowing from the plate, and had great fat content.The Anago didn't have that fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth texture; instead, it felt firmer. The hint of yuzu added a nice touch.The shining fish options (Kohada, Shime Saba, Aji) were tasty, but they didnÅft exceed my expectations.Compared to other gourmet conveyor belt sushi places, the prices here are somewhat on the higher side. If you go in expecting the taste of their main branch, you might be a bit underwhelmed, but overall, it's delicious sushi that you can enjoy casually, and I left satisfied! (^^)"
"Is it really necessary to say ""Kaiten""...?","Just a 1-minute walk from Omotesando Station A1.By registering as a friend on Line, you can get one plate for free. Each person has their own tablet at the counter, so even if you come with a friend, you can order at your own pace, which is really nice! Today's order featured the highlight, tuna from Yamakou, along with some of my favorite light fish and squid. We had a total of 17 dishes for JPY 8,910.It's hard to comment as the price, service, and taste feel somewhat average.It was a great meal!"
"Great value for the price, fresh octopus is amazing!","This high-end sushi restaurant that also offers conveyor and standing dining is celebrating its first anniversary this October. It's located just around the corner from the COACH store at Omotesando A1 exit. I visited on a weekday before 2 PM.There are different machines for reception depending on whether you're choosing conveyor sushi or standing dining. As it was my first visit, I was unsure which to pick, so I directly asked the staff member which option was more affordable. She informed me that the conveyor sushi is about 10% cheaper, so I went with that option. Since there were no customers waiting, I thought it would have been nice if someone offered assistance while I stood in front of the machine for over a minute.Once seated, I placed my order through the touch panel right in front of me. It was a slow time with few people around, and the unique red vinegar rice nigiri came out quickly. The most popular choice, medium fatty tuna for JPY 620 each, was absolutely delicious. As a fan of live octopus, I couldn't resist the active octopus with two pieces for JPY 420. The thickness is something you wouldn't find in regular conveyor sushi, and although tender, it had a perfect bounce.The mackerel, two pieces for JPY 420, was also expertly deboned... I feel embarrassed admitting that I usually only eat cheaper options. Overall, I enjoyed sushi toppings that matched the generous amounts of red vinegar rice. However, it took over 10 minutes for the final tuna rolls to come out, so it seems that rolls may take longer to prepare."
Casual Michelin Sushi Experience,"Sudden sushi cravings can be challenging to satisfy.This place is perfect for those moments.Enjoy casual yet authentic sushi served at the counter without rotation.For tuna lovers, there is a comprehensive tuna menu.I also recommend kohada (young gizzard shad).It's a great spot for solo diners, too.This sushi restaurant is perfect for satisfying those unexpected sushi cravings."
Yamakou's Authentic Bluefin Tuna,"When it first opened, there seemed to be long lines every day, but perhaps things have settled down a bit recently? On this day, I was able to enter without waiting. The interior still looks new and well-maintained, as it's been less than a year since the opening. Orders are placed using a touch panel device located at each seat. Although it's a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, the sushi doesn't actually rotate; everything is ordered via the device. I enjoyed about 10 pieces of sushi, including scallops, anago (conger eel), uni (sea urchin), and of course, the main attraction, the honmaguro (bluefin tuna). The tuna was truly exceptional. Even the fatty part (otoro) was not overly greasy and had a refined sweetness. Just for the chance to taste this tuna, it's worth a visit. All items are priced under JPY 1000 per piece. In terms of enjoying high-quality sushi at a reasonable price, this may be an interesting concept."
Happy 1st Anniversary!,"I've been going to the Kaiten Sushi at Omotesando lately, so I made a lunch reservation at the Ginza flagship store for next Saturday (^ ^).I discovered on Twitter that Onodera is holding a 1st-anniversary event from the 7th to the 10th!!Come to think of it, I first heard about the opening last October.I thought it was quite a feat to open during the pandemic, but theyÅfve been operating continuously,I finally visited for the first time this year, and today is my fourth visit.IÅfm excited to enjoy the sushi again after a long time (ÅOÅûÅO).The prices for nigiri have become more reasonable, and [b: the draft beer is half price!!]I wish Onodera would advertise more ( É÷ ).So, IÅfve changed my plans last minute and decided to go to Kaiten Sushi Onodera!!I woke up early and took a 1.5-hour walk as a pre-meal workout!!As I sneak through the stylish Omotesando, a not-so-flashy old guy like me is moving Åc There are so many cute people here (ÅVÉ÷ÅV).ItÅfs just a short walk from Omotesando Station, which is great.Even though I arrived right after the opening, itÅfs the 1st anniversary, so the place is pretty crowded (Å@ﬂÑtﬂ).As always, the staff kindly guided me to my seat.I learned that when entering from the right side, the staff will push your chair in for you (ÅP ÅP).But I still moved the chair myselfitÅfs just too embarrassing (ÅVÉ÷ÅV)(ÅVÉ÷ÅV)(ÅVÉ÷ÅV).I couldnÅft chat much with the itamae (sushi chef) since they were busy, but thatÅfs understandable (o^^o).Looking at the touch panel, it indeed shows that nigiri is a bit cheaper now.The menu has also expanded compared to before. The beer is half price as advertised!! Good good d(ÅP ÅP).The price for Dom Perignon remains the same É∞(ÅPÅBÅP…)….Today's tuna is from Toy in Hokkaido. My expectations are high!!LetÅfs start by ordering a beer. It was served by a beautiful staff member, lifting my spirits (ÅVÉ÷ÅV).Now, here comes the nigiri. LetÅfs start with my favorite, the shiny fish!!Å@Gari (pickled ginger): Sliced thinly in white vinegar, it has a wonderful balance of sweetness and acidity.Å@Å@Å@Å@Just this alone goes perfectly with beer...Å@Å@Å@Å@Until I noticed my glass was empty... So I ordered another round d(ÅP ÅP).Å@Shari (sushi rice): Delicious with a strong umami taste thanks to the red vinegar. Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@However, due to the kaiten sushi setting, the rice was a bit cooler than IÅfd prefer.Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@Since it was cold today, I would have liked it to be a little warmer (^ ^).Å@Aji (horse mackerel): The texture is plump and has a nice amount of fat.Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@The flavor was rich and didnÅft get overpowered by the red vinegar.Since the beer is half price, I felt like having some snacks!LetÅfs settle in and enjoy a drink!! I ordered squid tempura and another beer d(ÅP ÅP).Å@Squid Tempura: Lightly battered and fried. The salt is pink, likely rock salt.Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@The meat is plump and crunchy. ItÅfs delicious and surprisingly fresh!Å@Shime Saba (pickled mackerel): Large portions with a good amount of fat. The pickling was excellent.Å@Kohada (gizzard shad): This one was also large, but the flesh was a bit thin. Still, the pickling was good combined with red vinegar, bringing a delightful sensation.Å@Sanma (saury): Yes, they had saury!! And it was discounted!!Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@The flesh was thick and plump, rich in fat, and delicious!!Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@When I asked the itamae, he mentioned it was from Hokkaido. By the way, it sold out 30 minutes later...Å@Katsuo (bonito): They also served thick slices here. However, despite being labeled as returning, it wasnÅft fatty.Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@Nonetheless, it was still rich and delicious with a bold umami flavor. Perfect to go with beer (ÅOÅûÅO).Å@Buri (yellowtail): Another from Hokkaido, large and thick, plump, and rich in fat. Truly delicious!!Å@Å@Å@Å@I was impressed by the skillful knife work (Å@ﬂÑtﬂ).Å@Shrimp: Steamed shrimp, but it seemed lighter in color than before. I couldnÅft tell if it was kuruma shrimp...Å@Å@Å@Å@However, once I bit into it, I was surprised!! With every chew, the umami and sweetness burst out!!Å@Å@Å@Å@I was really impressed (@^É÷^@) Well done, Onodera!!Å@Akami (lean tuna): Alright, ToyÅfs tuna!! It had a solid umami flavor and aroma, and it was delicious!!Å@Å@Å@Å@Being lean, it still had a nice amount of fatfor JPY 320, itÅfs quite a bargain!!Å@Chutoro (medium-fat tuna): The fatty tuna melts in your mouth.Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@Once again, the oily tuna paired excellently with the red vinegar! Today was heavenly.Oh, I ran out of beer... So I ordered the Japanese sake, Taitou. Happy 1st anniversary!!There was a chorus of voices from the staff!! It was a bit embarrassing (ÅVÉ÷ÅV).While feeling festive, they poured me a full cup. Despite being under JPY 900, it was crisp with a nice umami.It had an unusual flavor, but I liked it.Å@Toro Taku (tuna with pickled radish): I savor the tuna slowly with the accompanying wasabi ( ÅL Å§ ` ).Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@The aroma and spiciness of the wasabi, the fat and fragrance of the tuna, the crunchiness of the takuan, and the umami of the sake.Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@Ah... [b: IÅfm truly glad to be born a Japanese person.]Å@Ramen: Perhaps due to my extended walk, I still had room in my stomach...Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@It was just the right amount for a final dish at JPY 320. It had a mild soy sauce flavor with a deep, subtle broth.Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@Even the chashu and noodles werenÅft overly prominent, and the service was fast ( o )/Suddenly, bells rang, and a large yellowtail was being prepared!!I thought I would add another sake and yellowtail to my order, but a staff member informed me, ""Your time is limited to 60 minutes,"" prompting me to leave my seat...ThatÅfs a bummer... I thought on my way home, but perhaps because I exercised a bit too much in the morning,I noticed I felt a bit warm on my way back. It might have been just the right time to leave (^ ^).I started to tell myself, ""YouÅfve been drinking too much this early in the day"" (  ).I enjoyed plenty of beer and sushi for just over JPY 7,000.IÅfll definitely make this a regular spot ( o )/I canÅft wait for next Saturday. I wonder if the quality of the ingredients will vary (^ ^)."
Ultimate Kaiten Sushi Åö,"Sushi Onodera @ OmotesandoWho would have thought there would be kaiten sushi here! As it's Onodera, it suits Omotesando well, but the atmosphere is surprisingly vibrant.

They use red vinegar, which adds to its beautiful presentation.Yamako Tuna AkamiÅöThe tuna melts in your mouthdelicious!Yamako Tuna ChutoroÅöIt melts even more the moment it hits my palate.Natural TaiÅöThere was quite a bit of wasabi, which overwhelmed the flavor of the fish.Homemade Simmered AnagoÅöItÅfs rich and melts in your mouth, but the bones were quite noticeable.Live HokkigaiÅöYou can tell itÅfs freshit has a great texture.Shima IkaÅöThick pieces, but they stuck to my teeth, which was disappointing.Shima AjiÅöThick and fresh.Ultimate Sea Urchin TastingÅöKanburi and Murasaki Uni.

This is a must-try!Overall, the sushi rice portions were small yet exquisite. The atmosphere was lively and very pleasant. Indeed, as others have mentioned, it hasnÅft completely transcended the level of kaiten sushi, but the freshness of the ingredients and their remarkable quality were truly impressive."
No.1 Gourmet Kaiten Sushi,"I visited here after a while because the standing sushi shop next door was closed.The conveyor is still running, but the sushi isn't moving.This time, I ordered:- Maokarei (2 pieces)- Ishigakigai (2 pieces)- Salmon (1 piece)- Flounder Engawa (2 pieces)- Sardine (2 pieces)- Nakaochi Gunkan (Tuna) (2 pieces)- Nakaochi Gunkan (Salmon) (2 pieces)- Yariika (2 pieces)- Toro-Taku Roll- Chutoro (1 piece)- Ara Soup- Taito (Japanese sake)And more.I ended up eating quite a lot. As a fan of fatty fish, I found the salmon, engawa, sardine, and chutoro to be the best.Each had a rich fattiness that melted in my mouth.Seasonal items like Ishigakigai and Maokarei were also fresh and delicious.My favorite here is the ara soup. ItÅfs loaded with meaty pieces from the fish bones and has no unpleasant odorjust wonderful.When you order the Taito sake, all the staff come together to cheer. This is a signature experience of the restaurant, so I recommend trying it at least once. It really lifts your spirits.For me, this is the No.1 gourmet kaiten sushi.It was a great meal!"
Choose what you want to enjoy,"Since it's been a hot topic, I definitely wanted to give it a try.I have an appointment near Omotesando that should wrap up around 10:30. So, I planned to skip breakfast and thought about this place for brunch.Arriving just before the 11:00 opening time, I was surprised to find that it was already open. It seems they've changed the opening time to 10:30 from July 1st. I was able to get in without a wait.Åõ Chawanmushi (Steamed Egg Custard)I thought this would be great to taste the dashi (broth), so I decided to start with it. As expected, itÅfs tailored for kaiten sushi (conveyor belt sushi). ItÅfs better than average, but considering it's 510 JPY, you canÅft expect the top-notch ingredients for the dashi. It's unreasonable to set high expectations.Åõ Ikijime Mako-garei (Recommended)This is delicious. I donÅft think youÅfd find this at regular kaiten sushi places.Åõ Kobore Namashirasu (Also recommended)Well, itÅfs probably not fresh from the morning, so it's just okay. It wasnÅft incredibly delicious either. I recently had some amazing fresh ones in Shizuka, so perhaps my expectations were too high. I should have skipped this one since the portion was quite large.Åõ Ara-jiru (Fish Bone Soup)This is good. ThereÅfs a huge piece of yellowtail or a large fish from its family in there, nicely cleaned with no unpleasant smell. The fish itself is substantial and filling. This 510 JPY feels like a real bargain. However, there are photos of sold-out items in the menu, so be cautious.Åõ Hon-Maguro Akami (Bluefin Tuna)This seems to be the highlight. The Hon-Maguro here is cut generously, and at 420 JPY per piece, itÅfs quite a steal.Åõ Kohada (Gizzard Shad)ItÅfs just so-so. I think it might be a bit too vinegary.Åõ Anago and Cucumber RollThis was a disappointment. Perhaps it was rolled by an apprentice, as it fell apart and the filling was unbalanced. This 620 JPY feels disrespectful.I wanted to try the shime-saba (marinated mackerel), but I donÅft have confidence in finishing two more pieces. I was already full from the ara-jiru and the kobore namashirasu. Plus, being at Onodera, I couldnÅft resist starting with the chawanmushi. So, feeling a little regretful, I decided to take away the saba bzushi (mackerel sushi).I just got home and tried a piece for my afternoon snack. Unfortunately, this was also disappointing. The mackerel was thick and perfectly marinated, beautifully wrapped in oboro (thinly sliced fish). The rice was tasty as well. Still, there was a slight flavor of mayonnaise between the fish and rice that ruined everything. What have they done to my beloved saba sushi? I'm so disappointed.ItÅfs a small point, but for older patrons, having items served in pairs makes it difficult to sample a variety by yourself. I checked the menu thoroughly. If you get used to it and know what to choose, it seems you could easily return for another visit.Total spent in the restaurant: 3,400 JPYSaba bzushi takeaway: 3,240 JPYI was able to experience a trendy place much sooner than I usually would, and IÅfm thoroughly satisfied with that."
Difficult to evaluate.,"When I think of it as a high-end sushi restaurant like Onodera, I'm left disappointed. However, if I consider it as conveyor belt sushi, it's quite acceptable. The sushi meets the standard for conveyor belt sushi. But when I think about the name on the sign, I feel a bit unsatisfied. I ordered sardines; the fish quality was good, but I was shocked to find the ginger accompaniment was pre-packaged, ready-to-use ginger. Delicious fish meets such poor quality ginger.It's nice to be able to enjoy high-quality sushi at a reasonable price, but it feels completely different from the original restaurant. In the category of conveyor belt sushi, it's actually tasty."

Incredibly Delicious Kaiten Sushi at Onodera!,"On my way back from Tochigi, I had a bit of time in Tokyo and decided to have lunch at Onodera. The last time I visited, it was extremely busy, and I had to take a ticket from the machine to secure a table, waiting quite a while before being seated.This time, I was prepared for a long wait, but surprisingly, due to it being a weekday at 1:30 PM, I was able to get in quite easily. It seems like many of the customers were tourists. The atmosphere inside was incredibly lively, and it felt like a bustling sushi restaurant. They also have a great selection of wine, so I decided to enjoy it alongside the delicious sushi.The price per plate ranges from JPY 600 to the low JPY 1000s. Every sushi piece was so delicious that I could easily keep eating. Among the dishes I had this time, I found the akagai (red clam) to be quite a bargain. As for the side dish, the fish bones and leftover parts soup was rich in flavor and very tasty.While enjoying my lunch at Onodera, a sudden torrential rain and thunderstorm caught me off guard. At that moment, I didn't foresee the big trouble that was about to come, and I was just taking it easy, but thatÅfs when a series of unfortunate events began.All in all, the sushi here is incredibly delicious, making it one of my favorite sushi spots!"
Kaiten Sushi featuring the renowned Yamako Tuna,"This restaurant is just a 1-minute walk from Omotesando Station. I had been curious about it since it opened, and I finally made it!To avoid the peak hours, I arrived at 5 PM, but since it's a popular place, I had to wait 20 to 30 minutes to be seated.You can place your orders using the tablet at your table. Of course, my main goal was to try the tuna from Yamazaki! Today, I had the lean tuna, chu-toro, along with pickled mackerel, yellowtail, and bonito. The chu-toro was so delicious that I ended up ordering it twice. Considering it's a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, the prices are on the higher side, but given the quality, I felt satisfied. Above all, I find this type of casual dining much more comfortable than stiff restaurants.It was a great meal."
The tuna is exceptional. It was the best sushi I've had with red vinegar.,"I've been wanting to try this kaiten sushi place for a while. I had planned to go when I returned home, but my schedule was tight, so I couldn't make it. Before heading back to Fukuoka, I visited on a Sunday at 1 PM and was seated immediately.I ordered 2 highballs:Otoro (fatty tuna) - JPY 930Tuna maki - JPY 510Marinated mackerel - JPY 420Marinated mackerel rolled with kombu - JPY 620Freshly caught kanpachi - JPY 510Total: JPY 4,230The otoro melted in my mouth the moment I took a bite. The red vinegar rice was just the right level of acidity, not too sour.This was the best sushi I've had with red vinegar rice so far.However, the prices are a bit too high for regular visits, which is a downside."
"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera: What Makes the Sushi at This Highly Talked-About Restaurant, Known for Winning the Highest Bid on Tuna, So Delicious? | Kazuya's Guide","[u:[b:ÅüÅüShonan Kazuya's SNS InformationÅüÅü][a:https://twitter.com/kzy0512,Twitter]Å@[a:https://www.instagram.com/kzy19750512/,Instagram] [a:http://ameblo.jp/kzy0512/,Blog][u:[b:ÅüÅüReview Content HereÅüÅü]Weekday Food WalkFood review from late June 2022On this day, I took a vacation from work and went to Omotesando to get a haircut. Of course, I couldn't just leave it at that.I decided to check out a restaurant I've been wanting to visit for a long time for lunch.I arrived at 'Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,' located just a 1-minute walk west from Exit A1 of Tokyo Metro Omotesando Station.In 2021, this restaurant made headlines by winning the top bid for tuna at the first auction held at Toyosu Market, breaking the stronghold that Sushi Zanmai had dominated yearly.They have been collaborating with 'Yama Ko,' a tuna wholesaler considered the best in Japan, securing the top tuna for four consecutive years.This establishment opened in October 2021 as a new brand run by ONODERA Food Service, with the head chef Sakagami overseeing it, aiming to make the quality cultivated at 'Sushi Ginza Onodera' accessible for everyone.Since the hair salon is nearby, I've passed by this restaurant many times and had been curious about it since before it opened.I thought it would be open by the time I next visited the salon, so I stopped by to see how things were going, only to find quite a long line!Apparently, it was featured on TV.It's particularly hard to go to restaurants in Tokyo without visiting before they get media attention.After checking it out a few more times over the next six months, I finally got a chance to visit.I arrived just before opening and registered at the E-PARK machine in front of the restaurant.With only about six customers ahead of me, I knew I could get in right away when my turn came.I waited on a free bench outside until the opening time.As more people started to gather just before opening, I waited near the entrance for my registration number to be called.Eventually, it was my turn, so letÅfs head inside.The interior is dazzling and luxurious. While this is a revolving sushi restaurant, there was no sushi rotating on the conveyor belt, and instead, orders were placed using a touchpad, with freshly made sushi served to us.The restaurant quickly filled up, and a line formed outside.The atmosphere inside is extravagant and luxurious.It may feel a bit flashy, but considering there is inbound demand, this level of expression could be acceptable.I was seated near the corner of the U-shaped counter.ÅEMenuThe sushi is ordered via the touchpad. The star item sourced through their collaboration with Yama Ko is, of course, the tuna.The lineup features visually extravagant toppings, and there is a sense of performance with each dish.There are many options for nigiri and gunkan, making it quite tricky to choose.Similar to a conveyor belt sushi shop, ramen and other side dishes are also available, which sets it apart from high-end sushi restaurants.It seems they offer a decent selection of alcoholic beverages, but since I was just before my hair appointment, I decided to hold off this time.This time, I wonÅft comment on each dish but will express my personal evaluation as ÅùÅõÅ¢Å~.ÅúKinmedai (Bream) ÅõÅúHouse-made Kobako (Baby Gobo) Å¢ÅúEngawa (Flounder Fin) Å¢ ÅúOverflowing Shirasu Gunkan Å¢ÅúYama Ko Premium Akami (Lean Tuna) ÅõÅúThick Live Scallop Åõ ÅúAkika (Red Squid) Åõ ÅúHouse-made Shime Saba Å¢ÅúYama Ko Premium Chutoro (Medium Fat Tuna) Åù ÅúOverflowing Ikura Gunkan ÅõÅúYama Ko Premium Otoro (Fatty Tuna) Åõ ÅúBafun Uni (Sea Urchin) Small Bowl ÅõÅúHouse-made Cooked Anago (Sea Eel) Å¢ ÅúYama Ko Premium Torotaku Hosomaki (Roll) Å¢Although it operates as a conveyor sushi restaurant, being able to enjoy 'Onodera' brand sushi at relatively reasonable prices might be beneficial for many customers.However, while I found the tuna sourced through Yama Ko and some toppings delicious, there were definitely some disappointing items as well.As someone living in the Shonan area, I was particularly let down by the sushi made with deteriorated raw shirasu that had become mushy; I wish they hadnÅft served this at such a venue.Of course, keeping the freshness of shirasu, even when provided locally, is challenging, so itÅfs fair to say that offering raw shirasu in Tokyo is quite rare and valuable, but I felt it was better not to serve disappointing sushi at all.While they serve sushi at affordable prices compared to high-end sushi places, it may be labeled as quite expensive compared to ordinary conveyor sushi restaurants. Therefore, given the high expectations and large customer turnout, I hope they strive to offer truly delicious sushi.ÅyKaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main StoreÅz5-1-6 Jingumae, Shibuya-ku, TokyoIl Palazzino Omotesando 1FTEL 050-3085-170010:30 AM - 10:30 PM (Last Entry 9:30 PM, Last Order 10:00 PM)Irregular Holidays"

Affordable Tuna Festival at Yamako! Let's support Onodera's wonderful efforts with a kind heart.,"Kaiten Sushi Ginza OnoderaThe Kaiten Sushi branch of the Onodera Group has opened in Aoyama. ItÅfs a popular spot with a lot of buzz, and I wanted to avoid the crowds that often come with hype, so I chose a less busy time to visit. On a weekday afternoon, I was able to walk right in without waiting. The spacious interior was surprisingly empty, which made me feel more at ease considering the current situation with COVID-19. You can park right in front of the building as well.However, if you visit outside peak hours, you might miss out on the exciting tuna cutting show, and there will be fewer sushi chefs available.The main attraction here is that they use the same high-quality ingredients as their luxury sushi restaurants, especially the tuna from the ""Yamakou"" brand, which you can enjoy at a reasonable price. That's what brings me here today, primarily to enjoy the tuna.As I entered, it had all the familiar trappings of a kaiten sushian ordering tablet and powdered tea were readily available. The level of detail in their setup is impressive! However, none of the sushi plates were circulating; it seems they prepare them freshly upon ordering. Given the current circumstances, I wouldnÅft feel comfortable grabbing plates that had been rotating in front of others.I noticed the selection of tuna was somewhat limited, so I decided to order a little bit of everything. They had hosomaki (thin rolls), but no futomaki (thick rolls), which was a bit disappointing.As for the tuna from ""Yamakou,"" I couldn't find the familiar yellow paper indicating its origin and weight on that day. If youÅfre going to promote ""Yamakou,"" they should proudly display that information. Unfortunately, the staff didnÅft offer any details, leaving me a bit concerned.I placed an order for akami (lean tuna), zuke (marinated tuna), and chutoro (medium fatty tuna). I was curious to see how they would turn out, but the dishes arrived almost immediatelymuch quicker than expected! Other reviews noted longer wait times, so it seems there may be quite a variance depending on customer volume.The akami was good.The zuke was... interesting?The chutoro was the best of what I ordered today.The otoro (fatty tuna) was a bit lacking. The hosomaki with toro-taku was alright too.Overall, the chutoro stood out as my favorite among the tuna I tried.This place might have a mixed reception depending on the visitor. One might classify it as an upscale kaiten sushi or a casual offshoot of a high-end sushi restaurant since it doesnÅft serve rotating plates. Their company strategy appears to target a unique niche in an industry divided between luxury and extremely affordable sushi, leaving us diners a bit confused as to how we should classify it.Regarding operation, when the restaurant is less busy, everything I ordered arrived promptly. Depending on the crowd and your pace, you may need to order accordingly. If itÅfs crowded, planning your orders ahead might be beneficial.As for the sushithe cutting, presentation, and seasoning was all a bit haphazard; as others have noted, the rice frequently spills from the sushi. The height of the hosomaki cuts varied as well.What stood out most to me was the temperature. Both the fish and rice were far too cold, which detracted from the tuna's quality. After receiving my dishes, I let them sit for a bit to reach room temperature before diving in.If youÅfre thinking of it as typical kaiten sushi, the casual vibe might seem fitting, but considering itÅfs priced more than double that of some chain kaiten sushi, thatÅfs where the disconnect comes in.While it should feature quality ingredients like those at fine establishments, the fact that itÅfs presented as ""Edomae"" sushi brings the carelessness of the preparation into sharper focus.Quality of fish is important, but this experience reminded me that craftsmanship""shigoto""is crucial as well.By the way, the Onodera Group has remarkable initiatives supporting sushi chefsÅf training and development. I imagine some of those academy graduates are working at this experimental location? So, if thatÅfs the case, you might find that youÅfre enjoying slightly more affordable sushi made by students still adjusting to real-life restaurant conditions. Thus, I think itÅfs reasonable to support Onodera's efforts while enjoying reasonably priced, delicious tuna to your heart's content!However, ordering too much otoro can add up quickly, and at that point, you might as well go for a more straightforward, budget-friendly sushi lunch instead. If you spent the same amount at a chain kaiten sushi, youÅfd likely be able to eat plenty.ItÅfs clear that evaluations might differ amongst patrons.Nonetheless, as a kaiten sushi experience, it generally meets basic expectations.It was a great meal.COVID-19 safety measures rating: 3"
Everything was delicious today except for the mackerel.,"I initially planned to visit a hamburger place called ""Yosh"" that just opened on the 16th, but it was temporarily closed, so I headed towards Omotesando Hills. On the way, I remembered that I hadnÅft been to ""Onodera"" in a while, so I decided to drop by.I was able to enter without waiting. HereÅfs what I ordered, in the order they were served:- 2 pieces of Shima Aji (JPY 650) - Delicious!- 2 pieces of Shime Saba (JPY 440) - Unfortunately, the Shime Saba was disappointing again. The last time, the fish wasnÅft great either...- 1 piece of Kohada (JPY 340) - The Kohada today was quite good.- 1 piece of Mackerel (JPY 280) - The mackerel was decent today.- 1 piece of Horse Mackerel (JPY 280) - The horse mackerel was excellent today.- 1 piece of Simmered Anago (JPY 640) - I believe this was my first time having the simmered anago here, and it was soft and flavorful, well-prepared with a rich glaze.- 2 pieces of Medium Fatty Tuna (JPY 620) - Was it about the size of a medium one? It had a relatively light flavor, which is understandable for tuna in March.- 1 Tuna Toro Takumaki (JPY 720) - It was okay.As I mentioned during my first visit, the sushi rice uses red vinegar, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. While the Shime Saba didnÅft impress, the other fish was better than last time, and the anago exceeded my expectations.Spending JPY 3970 for lunch is certainly not cheap, but worthwhile."
I've been curious about it since I saw it on TV.,"I had been looking forward to this place ever since I saw it featured on TV's ""Gaya no Yoake,"" ""Cambria Kyden,"" and in news specials. Ordering is done via a monitor, which made it a bit challenging for me as a first-time visitor. Even though it's a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, the conveyor had no plates on it. It was surprising to find that the sushi is made and handed directly to you at the table. All the blue fish options were delicious, and while the individual dishes were tasty as well, there were a few disappointing presentations. The tamagoyaki was so poor that I had to replate it for photos. Some plates had leftover rice due to the sweetness of the sushi rice. There were items that cost nearly JPY 1000 for a single piece, so I ordered cautiously. Depending on the time of your visit, it seems you can enter without waiting. After 4:30 PM on Sundays, there were open seats available, but a line formed again after 5:00 PM. You need to come with enough time to spare, but if it means no waiting, I would love to come back. Next time, I want to try all the blue fish options along with today's specials and seasonal items. On a side note, the kanpyo was a bit lackluster in sweetness for my taste."

At this price point, you can find even higher-level sushi in the city. I had high expectations for the honmaguro (bluefin tuna), but the otoro felt like chutoro, and the chutoro was at the level of akami (lean tuna). Well, it was tasty, but...It felt like classic ""kaiten sushi"" for better or worse. I have a better impression of Nemuro Maru and Mito Sushi for overall convenience. Thank you for the meal."
Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch,"A stylish and casual sushi restaurant in Omotesando. You can conveniently order using a touch panel. The staff was lively, friendly, and kind. The fatty tuna and nodoguro (black throat perch) were delicious! Even on weekdays, there were a few groups waiting by 6 PM, so it's best to arrive early."
Delicious Gourmet Sushi,"I had high expectations, which led to a bit of disappointment. The sushi was quite good, but I expected more after seeing the commercials on TV. I arrived at this kaiten sushi restaurant, Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, at 10:30 a.m. for an 11:00 opening, and I was able to issue a waiting ticket through epark. Once I got my ticket, I could wander around instead of waiting in line, which was a nice touch. Since I was about tenth in line, I got in right after they opened. Thanks to the recent TV ads, there were quite a few people waiting behind me at opening time. The interior was clean, and the chefs were energetically promoting the recommended items. The atmosphere felt lively. Interestingly, although the conveyor belt was running, there was no sushi going around; instead, orders were made via a touchscreen panel, and the chefs served freshly made sushi. Three chefs were handling a fully occupied restaurant, so the service was decent, taking a bit longer than expected but not excessively so. As for the sushi, the signature tuna was good, but I wondered if it was worth the hype. The akami was average, while the chutoro was pretty good. The quality of the fish might vary from day to day. I tried red vinegar sushi rice for the first time, and it was enjoyable without any strong flavors. We shared about 15 plates of our favorite items. None of the dishes were bad, but nothing left me feeling wowed either. However, I did enjoy the fresh sashimi from Mujoka (no unpleasant smell) and the surprise of the sprouted leeks (a delightful first-time experience). We also ordered the ara-ju, chawanmushi, and spent about JPY 10,000 for two people. Since it's gourmet sushi, I expected top-notch sushi flavors, but it felt average. Considering the speed of service, I felt the cost was a bit high. It might be reasonable when you factor in the location. I can't help but think I was overly optimistic; it's good sushi, but fairly expensive. The service was standard. If you want to enjoy quality sushi, you might find better value at a less expensive gourmet sushi place or perhaps a more upscale sushi lunch. Being able to enjoy favorite ingredients without any misses is definitely a charm. It would be nice if I could specify the sweetness of the sauce like I can with wasabi on the touch panel. The staff seemed a bit overwhelmed, as I noticed some rough edges. The sign outside still said 'Closed for Preparations' when I left, so I hope they get it all together soon!"

It is conveniently located just a one-minute walk from Omotesando Station Exit A1. I visited around 1:30 PM on a Saturday, and there were certainly many waiting customers. However, the store has a ticket-based numbering system, which allows you to wander away from the restaurant, which is quite generous. After strolling around Omotesando for about 30 minutes, I received an automated call notifying me that a seat was available, allowing me to enter.To start, I ordered based on the popular menu rankings introduced on the TV program ""Kaere Ma 10."" The price point is higher when compared to major budget sushi chains. Since they use ""Yama Ko"" Hon Maguro (real tuna), the quality certainly feels different from other revolving sushi chains. While the fish is refrigerated and therefore quite cool to the touch, you can choose the portion size of the rice, which tends to be smaller than average for revolving sushi.However, this type of restaurant can be tricky. Ordering 10 varieties of sushi and one roll along with a bowl came to about JPY 4500. It seems that to fill an adult man's appetite adequately, you would need to spend close to JPY 5000. While the ingredients are high-quality, I feel that for this price, you might as well enjoy sushi at ""Sushiro."" Alternatively, I would prefer to pay a little more and have a sushi course at ""Sushi Ginza Onodera"" (there's a JPY 5500 course). Overall, this place isnÅft really family-friendly. If a child were to devour the tuna, the father's wallet would definitely take a hit!  With the rising trend of standing sushi bars, the use of this place feels a bit complicated."
A generous rating for Onodera,"Dining at Onodera tends to cost around JPY 60,000 for two, so considering that, it's relatively affordable. The rating reflects the quality of their sea urchin, tuna gunkan, and fatty tuna nigiri. However, I feel that they have missed the mark on some key ingredients; the sea urchin not being enjoyable is a critical issue. For JPY 900, the taste at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant like this is quite disappointing. On the other hand, dishes like medium fatty tuna, eel, chawanmushi (savory egg custard), saba (mackerel), kinmedai (golden eye snapper), and katsuo (bonito) were quite delicious, showcasing the day's highlights."
"High for a conveyor belt sushi, but affordable for a sushi restaurant","I went to Omotesando for lunch with a friend.This is the kaiten sushi version of the famous Ginza restaurant Onodera.I haven't been to the sushi place in Ginza before, so I was curious to see what it was like.Even though it was around 1 PM on a weekday, there were about 10 groups ahead of us.After checking in, we received a receipt and were called to our table using some sort of automated voice system. We were seated relatively quickly.What I had wastoro (fatty tuna),uni (sea urchin),ebi (shrimp),aosa soup, and more.The total bill was about JPY 4000.The rolls are highly recommended.It's pricey for kaiten sushi, but it feels affordable for a sushi restaurant. However, the likelihood of returning is low.The sushi was prepared by a younger female chef along with about three other staff members managing the kitchen.Considering it's located in Omotesando, I wonder what the target demographic is, and the service at this price point feels a bit questionable, haha.Having experienced it once, I thought it was worth it! ^_^"
Great value for money if you visit before closing!,"On a rainy night, I had some errands nearby and thought I might be able to get in right away.I arrived around 7:30 PM and saw three people waiting in front of the restaurant.After getting a ticket from the automated system inside, there were 11 groups waiting, including those inside.I was seated in about 10 minutes at the waiting area, and around 8:00 PM, many customers began to leave.I was called shortly after and seated at the counter.The counter seating is a bit cramped, focusing on turnover, with acrylic panels placed high above.Ordering is done via a touchscreen, and tea and pickled ginger are self-service.Payments are made at the register by presenting the number card, so the system resembles that of a conveyor belt sushi restaurant.I checked the photo menu thoroughly.Nigiri sushi (2 pieces) ranges from JPY 400 to 700, while rolls start at JPY 300.I noticed that many limited items were already sold out!A large grouper (over 15 kg?) was brought in and made rounds in the restaurant.I chose three limited items that were still available, along with two others.*You can select the presence of wasabi and the size of the rice.- Grouper: JPY 720 (tax included)- Yellowtail (2 pieces): JPY 510 (tax included)- Bonito (2 pieces): JPY 510 (tax included)- Homemade marinated mackerel (2 pieces): JPY 420 (tax included)- Medium fatty tuna nakaochi gunkan (2 pieces): JPY 620 (tax included)- Yam Gobo roll: JPY 320 (tax included)The pickled ginger was pleasantly spicy, not sweet, and had a delightful Edo-style kick!Around 4-5 chefs seemed to have their own roles, bringing out sushi in no particular order.The rice is seasoned with red vinegar, resulting in soft and small nigiri that are excellent.All pieces were larger than typical while maintaining a good balance in thicknesscut well and not overly thick.Every piece was exceptionally fresh and delicious.The direct-sourced yellowtail was great, and the tuna, being a specialty here, had a rich flavor for the nakaochi as well.The marinated mackerel was fatty and delightful.As expected, I highly recommend the direct-sourced, specialty, and homemade items!Overall, the prices seemed reasonable, and I felt that every piece was of high quality.If you aim for the lower price range, the cost-performance is excellent.Given the generous portion sizes, the 9 pieces plus rolls filled me up nicely."
Premium Kaiten Sushi,"I arrived around 11 AM on a holiday and received a ticket with a 30-party wait. Even though it was just after opening, there was a huge line. I finally got in around 1 PM, which is typical for the Golden Week lunch rush. I had been eagerly awaiting the conveyor belt sushi, and since it's a panel-style, I could order as much as I wanted without worrying about the line. What I ordered included fatty tuna, lean tuna, sashimi mackerel, kohada, sea bream, engawa, crab miso, scallion, toro-taku roll, shellfish cucumber roll, natto roll, and some beer... Being part of the high-end sushi Onodera chain, it cost JPY 7,500expensive, but worth the satisfaction. The sushi was incredibly delicious, with a clear difference in quality compared to typical chain restaurants. Among them, there were some standout items, while others were just good. The lean sushi was decent; although the lean and fatty tuna were pricey, they didn't surpass my expectations that much. I mean, for fatty tuna, this level of taste is what I would expect. Of course, I was satisfied after eating, but... Now, let me highlight the truly impressive items I experienced: The scallion... it was refreshing with a rich, slightly bitter, and sweet flavor of green onions that filled my mouth, with a hint of plum adding to it. As for the shiny fish and white fish in general... I highly recommend these; donÅft underestimate them just because they are on the cheaper side. They were deliciously thickly cut, and every bite was immensely satisfying. Especially the engawa, which was astonishingly flavorful. The natto roll... to be honest, it was shockingly delicious, almost stealing the show. I wondered, was natto ever this good? Or could the potential of natto surpass that of fish? Either way, it was such an impressive dish that I could have been content with just that alone. Overall, while itÅfs pricey, the restaurant is always vibrant, allowing me to enjoy the best sushi while indulging in drinks during the daya perfect fit for Golden Week."
A Restaurant Worth Checking Out!,"This relatively new restaurant is spacious and clean.The sushi pieces are large and incredibly satisfying!!!All the sushi options are highly recommended.ThereÅfs a decent selection of a la carte items, making it perfect for a little break between dishes.The rice is made with red vinegar, which might surprise those who are not used to it or trying it for the first time.It would be great to have a few more types of alcoholic beverages available.The staff were very attentive as well.With the open counter, itÅfs enjoyable to watch the craftsmen at work.Considering the location in Omotesando and the deliciousness of the sushi, I think the prices are quite reasonable!"
A Memorable Sushi Experience,"I visited on Saturday at 6 PM.After waiting for 1 hour and 30 minutes, I was seated inside at 7:30 PM.The restaurant had a clean and lively atmosphere.I was looking forward to enjoying the red sushi rice as I placed my order.Åô Good points:- The chairs were really comfortable, making it a pleasant space for a long meal.- The gari (pickled ginger) had a smooth and pleasing taste, it was delicious.- The tea was tastier compared to chain restaurants.- The crab miso on the blue king crab gunkan was exceptionally good.Åö Points for improvement:- The hotaru ika (firefly squid) lacked flavor.- I didnÅft really appreciate the quality of the red sushi rice.- While the higher prices might be expected for the location, the experience didnÅft quite match the cost.Overall, it was a good experience.Thank you for the wonderful meal!"
Better than expected,"The No. 1 popular Chutoro (fatty tuna) was JPY 620 per piece, and it was sweet and delicious, though I did notice a bit of sinew. The anago (broiled eel), ikura (salmon roe), toro-taku (fatty tuna with pickled vegetables), and nodoguro (blackthroat perch) were all reasonably tasty, but considering that I could enjoy a 12-piece lunch course for JPY 5000 at Onodera in Ginza, I feel the cost performance could be better. Being in Omotesando, the casual kaiten sushi atmosphere is a definite plus, but since many items were sold out, I recommend ordering what you want right away. Also, despite being a kaiten sushi place, nothing actually rotates. All pieces are delivered directly over the counter, and it sometimes took 12 to 13 minutes for a single piece to be served."
"Bones are a bit sharp, and the sushi is quite firm.","I missed lunch, so I decided to go to a place that offers continuous service. That's how I ended up here.The tuna's red meat wasn't bad, so if you think of it as sushi, it's decent. But everything else, I'm not so sure about.The mackerel was thick, which was good, but I got a small bone stuck in my gums, and I had to remove it with my fingersdefinitely a first-time experience for me.Also, all the fish seems way too cold.The sushi was also too firm, and it had a cheap taste.In my opinion, the right price would be about 30% less than what they charge.It's really disappointing."
Kaiten sushi is still the best choice...,"Today, I visited Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera located in Omotesando! I was excited to try the tuna from Yamako, which is considered the best in Japan, and to indulge in the offerings from this esteemed location.Upon entering, I found a ticket system in place, and even with the influence of TV popularity, the place was packed past 1 PM! I was one of the many waiting! I waited for about 30 to 40 minutes before being seated.Ordering was done via a touch panel for tea and sushi. The gari (pickled ginger) was perfectly balanced, not too sweet, with a hint of spiciness.First, I tried the homemade kohada (marinated shad) and shime-saba (marinated mackerel), which were alright.Next, I enjoyed the Aosa seaweed miso soup.The Yamako hon maguro akami (red tuna) was up next, along with homemade boiled shrimp that were a bit overcooked. They came plated together, which was a bit disappointing.The boiled shrimp felt a little dry, lacking the juiciness I expected.However, the akami had a refreshing taste, and the knife skills were on point, with no sinews detected.Following that, the fresh saba (mackerel) seemed a bit too soft. I wondered if it was a fatty variety.The sweet shrimp were plump, and with three pieces served, it was quite satisfying.Then, I ordered the Yamako hon maguro chutoro (medium fatty tuna)Åc but before that plate arrived, another customer's scallion sushi was left on my plate. I discreetly moved it aside. The chutoro was cut skillfully as well, and it had a nice balance of fat with a refreshing taste.I also heard that the fried chicken was good, so I ordered it, but it turned out to be just average.The nakaochi gunkan (tuna collaterals) was rich and sweet, delicious indeed! I tried the grilled anago (sea eel) as it is also popular, but it was quite large and the small bones were quite noticeable.Finally, I ordered the Yamako hon maguro tekka maki (fatty tuna roll), which contained some sinewy parts, but it was tasty nonetheless!I considered ordering the yamako hon maguro otoro (fatty tuna), but I lost my enthusiasm.There was soy sauce on the table, but all the nigiri were already brushed with a sweetened soy sauce, so I didnÅft really need itÅc but I would have liked to hear a recommendation.The vinegared rice was made with red vinegar, which gave a touch of elegance without being overly strong. The ambiance felt very upscale!Having eaten at the main store before, I may have raised my expectations too high, leading to a bit of disappointment. The bill turned out to be quite pricey, maybe reflecting the brand value of high-end kaiten sushi?This experience made me think again about the true essence of tuna.I say this somewhat cheekily, but I really enjoyed todayÅfs meal. It was a great meal (Å‹Å§Å‹)!"
Delicious flavors,"The atmosphere of the restaurant is very stylish.The tuna is indeed delicious.Since it was just broadcasted on ""Kaere ma 10,"" I thought the waiting time might be extremely long, but since it was cold and rainy, and I went around 1:45 PM after the lunch peak, I was seated in about 30 minutes.I tried all the top-ranked items.In addition to the popular menu, the horse mackerel was tasty.Although it is a kaiten sushi place, it is a bit pricey, so I would appreciate more tuna in the rolls and a more appealing presentation."
Popular High-End Kaiten Sushi,"This is the Kaiten Sushi version of ""Ginza Onodera"".Located in a prime spot just after turning at the intersection of Jingumae 5-chome from Omotesando, it's lined up with ""Tachi Gaki Sushi Onodera"".Upon entering the restaurant, you register your arrival using a touch panel. If you register your phone number, you will receive an automatic call when itÅfs your turn, whether you wait nearby or a bit further away.On a Saturday at lunchtime, there were about 10 groups waiting. I was seated in approximately 40 minutes.Although itÅfs called kaiten sushi, there is hardly anything revolving; only the menu signs are present. After placing orders from the touch panel, sushi plates are handed over to you directly from inside the conveyor belt area. Occasionally, sushi does come around on the belt, but hardly anyone takes it.Wouldn't it be fine without the conveyor belt?Without worrying about that, I kept ordering.Prices are for one piece for item á@ and two pieces for everything else.

The Yamako Chutoro was great too, but it paled in comparison to the yellowtail in terms of flavor. The price was also very reasonable, especially since it comes in two pieces.The saltwater sea urchin was understandably fresh with no unpleasant odor, and its sweetness was exceptional. I hadn't encountered a good sea urchin recently due to the rising prices, so this was a pleasant surprise.On the other hand, the conger eel was disappointing. The flesh was thick, and I had imagined it to be tender reminiscent of flan, but it had a sponge-like texture. It left me craving a drink.Other than that, everything else was delicious for the price.The total bill was around JPY 7,000 per person."
"A high-end chain, yet still a kaiten sushi.","This is a new type of restaurant from the famous Sushi Ginza Onodera, known for its high cost-performance lunch. It is located across the street from the Apple Store in Omotesando.Various media outlets have featured this place, and on the day of my lunch visit, they were filming ""KaeremaÅ¸n"".The appearance is just like a typical conveyor sushi restaurant, and the ordering system is through a touchscreen. However, there was nothing on the conveyor belt, which seems designed to lower the barrier for customers primarily interested in conveyor sushi. What I had (Åù = especially memorable)- Kuwahagi with liver- Shime Saba- Sea Bream- Toro-taku Roll- Sardine- Yamazaki Hon-Maguro Akami Zuke- Yamazaki Hon-Maguro Chutoro- Yamazaki Hon-Maguro OtoroThe total bill came to about JPY 5,000.The sushi had a very typical conveyor sushi feel, served in a way that felt almost ""cut and placed on rice."" I didn't find anything particularly memorable, including the Hon-Maguro from Yamazaki.With a counter-focused layout and a rise in efficient sushi restaurants, I couldn't find a compelling reason to specifically eat here. It left me with an impression of ""slightly refined conveyor sushi.""This place may be more appealing to those looking for something trendy rather than those wanting to try high-end sushi."
A Kaiten Sushi Spot Perfect for Dates,"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in Omotesando.This place has a luxurious interior that one wouldn't expect from a revolving sushi restaurant, making it perfect for a date!Although the decor and name might raise some eyebrows, the sushi is carefully prepared and the prices are quite reasonable.This time, I had the following:- 2 pieces of Shima Aji: JPY 420- 2 pieces of homemade Shime Saba: JPY 420- 2 pieces of live Tsubugai: JPY 840- 1 piece of premium Chutoro from Yamakatsu: JPY 620- 2 pieces of live Mirugai: JPY 620- 2 pieces of Akagai Nigiri: JPY 720- 2 pieces of Engawa: JPY 420- 1 piece of house-made Steamed Shrimp: JPY 320- 2 pieces of Shima Iwashi.I enjoyed all of this with some chilled sake.I was delighted to see a variety of my favorite shellfish.The texture was superbly crunchy as well."
Highly recommend the Tuna,"This is the kaiten sushi version of the famous sushi restaurant, Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, located near the Apple Store in Omotesando.Reservations cannot be made, so it's a first-come, first-served system with ticket distribution. On a Sunday around 5:30 PM, I got in after about 30 minutes of waiting for the ticket. (I recommend arriving earlier than your desired time, as this place is very popular.)They use tuna from the well-known supplier ""Yama Ko,"" offering a variety of tuna cuts including fatty tuna (O-Toro), medium fatty tuna (Chu-Toro), lean tuna (Akami), and Toro-Taku. The O-Toro was especially rich and had a heavenly melt-in-your-mouth texture. However, the Toro-Taku seemed to have a bit less tuna than expected, which was disappointing. You can also order without rice, but I felt that having the rice enhanced the flavor of the tuna, so I would recommend ordering it with rice.While the prices are higher than typical kaiten sushi, many high-end sushi places only offer courses, which can lead to feeling full before trying everything. This place is perfect for enjoying high-quality sushi while being able to choose your preferred toppings, especially the tuna."
Yamakou Hon Maguro,"On September 18 at 10:17 AM, I visited Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in Omotesando despite the rain.I ordered one piece of lean tuna and one tekka maki. The tuna from Oma was delicious, of course, but personally, I prefer the one from Toi. This is my fourth time at a kaiten sushi restaurant, so I think I'll try a standing sushi bar next."
Non-Conveyor Sushi,"I had been curious about this place.On my nephew's birthday, he wanted sushi, so we visited with four people. Being a rainy Friday, there were a few groups waiting around 6 PM. I thought it might take a while for a table for four, but we were promptly seated at a booth.Ordering is done via a touch panel, and the chefs prepare the sushi right there.Even though it's a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, nothing is actually rotating. I wonder what the conveyor is for? (laughs)The prices are not cheap; high-end pieces are over JPY 800 each, but there are also items starting from JPY 200 for two pieces. So, depending on what you order, it can be reasonably priced. However, if you indulge in what you want, expect to spend around JPY 7000.The sushi was delicious, and they use red vinegar for the rice, which was on the smaller sidesimilar to what you'd find in a high-end sushi restaurant.Considering that, it feels like a bargain for enjoying high-quality sushi, albeit on conveyor belt plates with clear pricing.Everything we ate was delicious, so I left feeling completely satisfied."
Deliciously Finished Mackerel (),"I had a great experience.Even though it was a weekday around noon, there was no line or waiting customers, so I was easily drawn in.HereÅfs what I ordered:Ankimo JPY 510Tempura of seafood JPY 420Baby sardine sushi JPY 320Red tuna sushi JPY 420Medium fatty tuna sushi JPY 620Marinated red tuna sushi JPY 510Shime-Saba JPY 420The tuna comes from Yamazaki. I ordered each of the sushi items as individual pieces, except for the shime-saba.The sushi featured sushi rice made with red vinegar, and the toppings were brushed with a sweet sauce before serving.All the dishes were very delicious (), especially the ankimo and shime-saba.The tuna was good, but the smoky flavor from the rice or sweet sauce stood out more with the tuna and baby sardine, which was a slight disappointment.The restaurant was very clean, with a calm atmosphere, yet there was a lively vibe. I noticed a few women dining alone as well.The service was decent, though one staff member behind the counter kept repeating questions, which was a bit irritating, but still within acceptable limits.I unexpectedly had some time during lunchtime, so I decided to stop by, but I didnÅft think of going for kaiten sushi in Omotesando. If the same situation arises, I would definitely consider visiting again."
Especially high satisfaction with the rolls,"A recently popular spot, this kaiten sushi is brought to you by none other than 'Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera.' It's said you can enjoy high-quality sushi at a reasonable price. I wanted to check it out, but I anticipated it would be super crowded since it's featured in the media. However, I arrived on a weekday at 4 PM and was able to get in right away.I'm thrilled to indulge in tuna from Yamako. While the nigiri is great, I particularly enjoyed the rolls. The tuna is so delicious that wrapping it with red sushi rice in crispy nori is simply perfect. The Nakaochi Gunkan Sushi was also top-notch.Ordering through the touch panel is easy, and the sushi comes out quickly. Instead of a conveyor belt, all orders are handed directly. There are plates of different sizes stacked, so it might be a bit confusing when you receive them.The interior is clean and the staff is lively. Overall, it seems like a great place!I think I had around 10 plates for about JPY 4,500. Each piece is small, so I didn't feel overly stuffed, but I was certainly satisfied with the quality. It was a great meal!"

What is Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera?Ginza Onodera, which started offering Kaiten Sushi and standing sushi in October 2021, has been frequently featured in the media.ItÅfs known as a Michelin-star restaurant, which I thought was out of my league, but maybe as a fan of B-class gourmet, I could try their Kaiten Sushi?According to their website, it states:""From Ginza to the world.""""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, based in Ginza, Tokyo, has 12 locations across 5 regions worldwide, aiming to spread refined Japanese culture through food.""Hmm. As I researched the restaurant, it turns out that Ginza Onodera isnÅft just sushi; they also offer tempura, teppanyaki, and French cuisine.[Locations of Ginza Onodera as of March 2022]- ""Sushi Ginza Onodera"" in Ginza, Shanghai, Hawaii, Los Angeles, New York- ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch"" in Omotesando- ""Standing Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch"" in Omotesando- ""Sushi Ginza Onodera Second Branch"" in Futako-Tamagawa- ""Tempura Ginza Onodera"" in Ginza, Shanghai- ""Charcoal Grilled Ginza Onodera"" in Ginza- ""Teppanyaki Ginza Onodera"" in ShanghaiThe ""Charcoal Grilled"" location is a mystery, but it seems to be a French restaurant.

Hmm.Recently, though, I came across a review saying the lines weren't that bad. Really?Just then, I was going out to dinner with my friend O-kun, and when I mentioned wanting to go to ""Onodera,"" he seemed interested as well, and we quickly made plans.According to O-kun, ""When I tried to make a reservation at Onodera in Hawaii, I couldnÅft get one."" So, itÅfs a sort of revenge visit for him. Wow, I didnÅft even know they had a location in Hawaii until then.So, while the lines didnÅft seem too severe, we agreed that the best time to go would be early on a weekday evening, and we set a meeting time for 5:30 PM.Our timing was perfect, and we didnÅft wait long to be seated.The sushi we tried was exquisite, just as we hoped. I initially thought it might not be that great, but it exceeded our expectations.However, IÅfd suggest having a budget of at least JPY 5000.It felt like a high price for Kaiten Sushi but reasonable for high-end sushi.Even if you drink a lot and order the pricier items, it seems you would still get change from JPY 10,000.2. Appearance, menu, reservation system, and atmosphere of Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in OmotesandoIt's been a while since I visited Omotesando.Near Omotesando IntersectionI usually walk from Harajuku or Shibuya, but I suddenly wanted to arrive a bit earlier, so I took the subway.The ""Kaiten Sushi Onodera"" is located a little further down from Omotesando Intersection, where you walk towards Harajuku and turn left.The exterior of Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch (first view)Good news, thereÅfs no line.The entrance on the right is for ""Standing Sushi Onodera.""The exterior of Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch (second view)I wasn't sure if that one was open. But since we aimed for the Kaiten Sushi, I only took a quick glance before heading inside.They also have a takeout menu. The Bara Chirashi looks incredibly delicious, but itÅfs JPY 3,240.Inside, thereÅfs a machine for accepting numbers and issuing tickets.I grabbed ticket number 19 and sat down in the waiting area.This is where I met O-kun.From this angle, the atmosphere of the restaurant looks like this.The front has a U-shaped counter where several sushi chefs are working. Similar setups can be seen in my favorite active sushi spots.After a moment, we were guided to our seats.The place felt quite upscale.As time passed, I noticed the lighting was just perfect for taking photos. It seems theyÅfve carefully considered that customers would post on social media.The wall displayed the recommended dishes of the day:The recommended daily menu posted inside Kaiten Sushi Ginza OnoderaBasic orders were made via a touch panel.It was the familiar system thatÅfs seen at popular places like Sushiro and Kura Sushi, but O-kun was amazed saying he had never seen it before since he typically doesnÅft eat at Kaiten Sushi.I realized again how different our life paths have been since our student days. (laugh)Now, as I looked at the touch panel, I was shocked at what I saw.This homemade marinated mackerel kombu roll. I was planning to order it since it looks so Instagrammable, but sadly, it was already sold out. Sweat.Also, there was a much-coveted fish called ""Kue"".Though it looks grotesque, itÅfs currently waiting for stock.And finally, simmered anago (conger eel).I definitely meant to order this, but I realized I forgot to eat it.2. What I had at Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in Omotesando2.1 Sushi and appetizersThe bill was separated, and we ordered separately. However, the drinks bill was handwritten and combined for two people.The photos IÅfll post here primarily focus on what I ordered, but IÅfve included some dishes where I just took a quick picture.To start, the ankimo (monkfish liver) was quite a surprise.Ankimo @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoThey clearly used fresh and high-quality ingredients. This might have been the best ankimo IÅfve ever had. The texture was superb, and the delicately light seasoning was perfect.Next, we had shrimp fried whole in the shell.Whole shrimp fried in the shell @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoThe combination of seaweed salt and lemon was perfect. I enjoyed them crispy, right down to the shells.And then there was the mackerel.Mackerel @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoAs an oil-loving person, I always order this at sushi places, and it was fantastic. The melt-in-your-mouth texture was the best. The rice was red rice that had a mix of red vinegar. The portion size of the sushi was also more than adequate.Next were the two dishes O-kun had: shime saba (marinated mackerel) and maaji (jack mackerel).Homemade shime saba @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoMaaji @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoMeanwhile, I ordered the rich salmon belly.Rich salmon belly @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoSalmon is generally delicious, but this one was rich, and both the fatty part and the lean part were tasty.Finally, I ordered three pieces of ""Yamaco Hon Maguro"". I was determined to try this.First, the tekka maki (tuna rolls).Yamaco Hon Maguro tekka hosomaki @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoThe tuna was a bit larger with a golden ratio, making it delicious. Though there were some tough parts, when bitten, it brought out the flavors. This was classic good tuna.Next was the chutoro (medium fatty tuna).Yamaco Hon Maguro chutoro @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoThis was the one item that didnÅft impress me much that day. It wasnÅft overly fatty. The appearance was even more red than expected.But the final piece, the otoro (fatty tuna), was an artistic vision of marbling.Yamaco Hon Maguro otoro @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoIt was incredibly tender and delicious. By the way, the chutoro is JPY 620 per piece, and the otoro is JPY 930.3.2 DrinksFor drinks, we had two beers and one glass each of white and red wine.Premium Malts (medium) and Premium Malts (glass).Initially, I thought the glass might be too small, so I ordered the medium, but even that wasnÅft a lot. I had the glass at the end.The wine was ""Payrelle Reserve."" The white was ""Payrelle Reserve Sauvignon Blanc"" from the Languedoc region of France, and the red was ""Payrelle Reserve Pinot Noir"" also from the Languedoc region of France.The Sauvignon Blanc had a noble flavor reminiscent of Chardonnay, and it was delicious.The Pinot Noir didnÅft have as much body as I expected. I regretted that it was chilled, as it's one of those things that is usually best served at room temperature in sushi restaurants.The total bill was around JPY 13,000. O-kun ended up paying a bit more because he ordered more.Overall, it was highly satisfactory and reasonable, although I wouldnÅft say they had an exceptionally skilled team of sushi chefs.4.

"Delicious, but probably won't return. The target audience is somewhat unclear.","I stopped by around noon on the weekend and there was a wait of 27 parties! So I decided to come back on a Monday around 4:30 PM. There was no wait at all, and the restaurant was about half full.The sushi wasn't on a conveyor belt; instead, it was ordered via a touch panel. What stood out to me were the engawa (flounder fin) and the shime saba (vinegared mackerel) wrapped in kombu. I'm not usually a fan of engawa, but it was really delicious! The horse mackerel was thick, but it was just okay. The uni (sea urchin) was small, one bite size, but there was too much sushi rice compared to the uni, making it hard to taste.We tried various items like shrimp, amaebi (sweet shrimp), tuna, squid, and sardine. Four of us had a total of 36 plates for JPY 17,700.While it was tasty for a conveyor belt sushi place, those with money looking for something special would probably choose a high-end restaurant, especially when there are so many affordable sushi spots that are quite delicious. I didn't quite understand the target demographic. There might be many first-time visitors just giving it a try, but I doubt it will attract many repeat customers.The staff were friendly and energetic, but it came off as a bit cheap in feel. If this is positioned as a high-end sushi restaurant with a conveyor belt, a more polished service might be appropriate.It seems you could walk in without a wait during early weekday hours.It was a great meal."
"Delicious, but too many items are out of stock","There were quite a few regular menu items, including bottles of white wine, that were out of stock. By the end, the only thing left was soup with nori. This is unexpected for a Sunday around 1 PM.The tables weren't even cleared, and while there might have been unexpected guests, it still felt off.However, the tuna from Yamazuki was indeed delicious. The portions were large, the knife work was well done, and the red rice was also very good."
Kaiten Sushi at Ginza Onodera!,"The tuna from Yamakou is incredible!!!I ended up eating a lot of tuna.The rolls were a bit disappointing, and quite a few items were sold out.Even though it's a conveyor belt sushi place, nothing was actually revolving.You can order via the touch panel, and they serve fresh sushi right out of the chef's hands. The quality is outstanding compared to other conveyor belt sushi restaurants! I definitely want to come back."
More than just conveyor belt sushi; on par with counter dining at Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,"For my second stop, I went to a nearby Kaiten Sushi restaurant. I thought to myself, ""Can I really handle this?"" But I impulsively went in, thinking that with a conveyor belt sushi, it might be okay to only order a few pieces?!So this is the Kaiten Sushi Onodera featured in WBS! ItÅfs located in quite a prime area.The interior has a more upscale feel compared to typical conveyor belt sushi places, giving it a slightly mature atmosphere. Moreover, thereÅfs a large mirror in the back that makes the space look twice as wide! ÅûChirashi Sushi and assorted nigiri to-go: JPY 7800"

Manage your expectations?,"I decided to have lunch in Omotesando, and since I had some free time, I made my first visit to Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, which I had been curious about! I was prepared for a wait, but perhaps because it was a weekday, I was able to get in smoothly!I was seated at the counter and ordered through the touch panel in front of me. As expected given the Onodera name, the prices are significantly different from those at regular chain conveyor belt sushi restaurants (laughs). With high expectations, I ordered a comparison of head-on shrimp, kinmedai (golden eye snapper), sea urchin, sardines, horse mackerel, medium fatty tuna from Yamazaki, squid, tekka maki (tuna rolls), and of course, anago (grilled eel) at the end! I made sure not to forget the miso soup with fish scraps.Today's miso soup was made with salmon scraps and was hearty with large pieces of salmon. The restaurant was about 80% full, but I wasnÅft kept waiting too long, and the dishes came out smoothly. Although it's a conveyor belt sushi place, the sushi is primarily prepared by the chefs who serve it directly to you right after making it.I took a few photos, but honestly, there wasnÅft anything that particularly impressed me. Perhaps I had too high of expectations, especially considering the price in this area, which isnÅft low, and for that price, the quality of the sushi didn't seem to match. I ordered a lot, so I left full, but I didnÅft feel very satisfiedwhat a disappointment. The biggest letdown was that the anago, which I always have to have as my finishing dish, had a bit of a fishy smell and didnÅft close the meal nicely.It was a great meal!"
Affordable Sushi at Onodera ,"I heard on the news that the high-end sushi restaurant ""Onodera"" has opened a conveyor sushi location in Omotesando, so I went there right away! Even though it's conveyor sushi, the prices are still a bit high, just like at Onodera!There were many unique offerings, but no tamago (egg)!?(I always have to order tamago when sushi arrives.)A bit hesitantly, I asked the staff, ""Do you have tamago?"" and they informed me that itÅfs not listed on the menu, but is available as a special item.Without knowing the price, I ordered the tamago...What arrived was actually ""tamagoyaki"" (Japanese omelet)!!It was fluffy, freshly made, and mildly sweetdelicious!The quality was so high! As expected from Onodera! I was impressed!(I forgot to take a picture of the all-important tamago...)"
Kaiten Sushi at Ginza Onodera,"We decided to have a sushi lunch, and chose to visit Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, which I had been wanting to try for a while. It opens at 11 AM, and even though we arrived a bit late, we got in without any issues. It started to get crowded right after us, so we were lucky! (laughs) Though it's a conveyor belt sushi place, the sushi isn't sitting out; instead, they bring it to you once you order! The comparison between the Nodoguro (blackthroat sea perch) and uni (sea urchin) was delicious! The medium-fatty tuna ( chutoro) was also tasty. It was inexpensive, so I might go back again! ^_^"
Kaiten Sushi by Onodera Group,"While searching for places on Tabelog, I came across a restaurant with delicious-looking red vinegar sushi, and it turned out to be part of the Onodera Group. When you think of the Onodera Group, you think of their incredible track record, including being the top bidder for the first tuna auction in Toyosu, earning Michelin stars, and being recognized as one of Tabelog's top sushi restaurants in Tokyo. I had to go! ^_^After work in the city, I visited for dinner. I parked my car at a nearby coin parking lot and arrived at 6:50 PM with a companion. It was crowded, but we were able to enter without waiting, though customers arriving after us had to wait. This place is quite popular.We sat at the counter and placed our orders via the touch panel. Although it's called Kaiten Sushi, the sushi wasnÅft actually rotating on the conveyer belt! (laughs)**Order:**Two pieces of medium fatty bluefin tuna, Yama KouÅfs lean bluefin tuna, homemade simmered anago (sea eel), snow crab, genuine squid, whole head botan shrimp, lightly grilled engawa, grilled nodoguro (black throat sea perch), todayÅfs select sea urchin small bowl, Yama KouÅfs fatty bluefin tuna maki, and Aosa seaweed soup from Ise-Shima.The quality here is definitely not what youÅfd expect from a conveyor belt sushi restaurant. In fact, thereÅfs no sushi actually rotating! I love the red vinegar rice. The Yama Kou bluefin tuna and homemade simmered anago were both delightful.We enjoyed a lot, and the total came to JPY 7,000, tax included, for one person. I definitely want to come back! It was a great meal."
Kaiten Sushi at Ginza Onodera,"I visited the Kaiten Sushi branch of the ""Ginza Onodera Group,"" which opened in Omotesando last autumn.I arrived around 11:05, shortly after the weekend opening, and there were a few seats available. We were quickly seated, but soon after, more customers came in and it became fully booked.The interior is bright and flashy, but it doesn't feel particularly high-end.By the way, the sushi doesnÅft revolve; instead, you order via a touch panel system.We toasted with a ""draft beer"" and started with ""fried squid legs"". We then ordered a variety of fish, starting with ""cold gray mullet,"" ""natural sea bream,"" and ""stone bream,"" followed by ""Yamako Hon Maguro Akami,"" ""purple sea urchin,"" "" bafun sea urchin,"" ""seared salmon,"" ""homemade simmered conger eel,"" ""red sea bream,"" and ""live yellowtail,"" along with ""Aosa seaweed soup from Ise-Shima.""In terms of taste, the sushi's quality, from the toppings to the skill of the chef, feels like it's positioned between high-end sushi and local sushi shops, which is reflected in the pricing.In other words, while it isn't top-tier sushi, its quality and offerings stand out from cheap conveyor-belt sushi and neighborhood sushi establishments. I believe it is a welcoming place that will appeal to the mid-range customer base."
Not the quality you'd expect from a conveyor belt sushi!,"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, as you might have heard, is a place worth visiting for its high-quality sushi. While it might be on the pricier side for a kaiten sushi restaurant, considering it's in Ginza, I believe itÅfs perfect for families. You can enjoy your meal casually and take as much as you want. I really enjoy kaiten sushi! The castella-style egg and the freshly made tamagoyaki from the skilled chefs were truly delicious. The anago (conger eel) was expertly prepared, and the rolls made with saba (mackerel) were incredibly tasty. Is the tuna from Yamazukuri? Everything had high quality, the restaurant was new and spotless, and it even seems like you can make reservations despite it being a kaiten sushi place. ItÅfs likely to rank first among kaiten sushi spots in Tokyo, at least in my family's chart."
Delicious Kaiten Sushi Every Time,"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in OmotesandoI went shopping in Omotesando for the first time in a while and heard there was a kaiten sushi (conveyor belt sushi) from the luxury sushi restaurant ""Ginza Onodera,"" so I decided to check it out.To my surprise, the quality was outstanding, featuring delicious cuts like medium-fatty tuna and fresh mackerel that you wouldnÅft expect from a kaiten sushi place! (Åù_Åù;)There was even a tuna filleting demonstration during my visit.This is definitely one of the places I want to return to."
Great location at this price,"The management's response time has definitely improved.Now, regarding this restaurant, it has a great location and quality at this price.It's a conveyor belt sushi, but the sushi doesnÅft flow.They deliver your orders promptly.When I entered, it was peak hours, so I had to write my name and wait for a while, but by the time I left, there were hardly any customers.Depending on the time of your visit, there might be a wait.While some of the ingredients are on the expensive side, you do get a decent quality.During busy times, they might forget your order, but the overall service atmosphere is quite good.I was more satisfied than with conveyor belt sushi in Tsukiji.In that sense, I would give it a high rating."
"Interesting experience, but once is enough! ","Since it's been a while since they opened, I thought I'd have to try it to really understand! I lined up 15 minutes before opening on Saturday.The interior is spacious, and it seems like there would be room for more customers right when it opens.I was there until around 11:30, and by that time, there was one group waiting.Ordering is done via a touchscreen. While there are rotating sushi plates, many of them were just going around without anything on them.Only the items I ordered were brought to my table by the staff.I ordered a few interesting pieces. The rare items were sold out quicklyalmost instantaneously!The vinegared mackerel wrapped in kombu was unique and quite delicious. The medium fatty tuna was also good.Although the food came out quickly, I was disappointed to find soy sauce splattered on the plates. It's nice that they apply it for you...I do like warm sushi rice, but the pieces were made too loosely, making it difficult to pick up the anago (sea eel), and I ended up leaving a lot of rice on the plate.The sloppy presentation really reminded me that itÅfs still a kaiten sushi place.While I don't intend to compare it with non-rotating sushi restaurants, the lack of attention to detail compared to other kaiten sushi places stood out.Given my expectations, I was quite disappointed.It was a great meal."
Michelin-Starred Kaiten Sushi,"Opened in October, this kaiten sushi restaurant is supervised by ""Ginza Onodera,"" ensuring a top-notch selection of fish! Enjoy premium tuna cuts including chutoro, otoro, marinated akami, and akami. The presentation is charming, and the ingredients are impeccable! It's highly recommended for those who want to enjoy authentic sushi easily."
"Delicious Sushi: Second Visit to Omotesando ""Onodera""","This is the kaiten sushi version of Ginza Onodera, located in Omotesando.It's positioned as a budget-friendly optiona perfect introduction to the gourmet sushi experience, and it's certainly delicious!On this day, they had just acquired some fresh tuna at auction, and when we were seated, they handed us an ""order ticket"" and asked, ""Would you like to place your order now?"" Naturally, we did, and it was delicious.While the sushi is tasty, the variety of toppings is somewhat limited.The sushi is made without using seasoned soy sauce, so the rice has a nice flavor on its own.Most pieces are around JPY 400 each.The most expensive was the uni (sea urchin) at JPY 800, I believe.Reservations are not accepted.There is a ticket machine in front of the restaurant where you check in.I was told it would be a one-hour wait, but it was actually about 30 minutes.There are lanes, but they weren't busy at all.The restaurant is spacious and very clean.Despite its size, there are few seats, making it feel quite comfortable.Expect your budget to be around JPY 5000 to JPY 7000 per person.Given this, it's a great way to enjoy the atmosphere of a high-end establishment."
What is Michelin-starred Kaiten Sushi? @Omotesando,"I visited the Kaiten Sushi run by Onodera in Omotesando! The energetic atmosphere of the restaurant is as lively as the fresh fish! Everything is operated via touch panels, so I tapped away... and my order arrived in no time. Even though it's a conveyor belt sushi place, there was nothing on the conveyor during my visitprobably seasonalso the staff brought my orders directly to my table with a smile. - Tobikko (fish roe) This is a classic. And it's incredibly delicious!! - Kohada (gizzard shad) The rice is seasoned with red vinegar, which complements the house-made marinated kohada perfectly. I had to get a second serving! - Natto Maki (fermented soybean roll) You can choose from three toppings to go on top, and I picked all of them. The plum was delicious! Surprisingly, they also have bottle and glass wines available. They even have Lamone's Monrachet on the menu! As expected from a top sushi restaurant in Ginza, the quality holds up even in a conveyor belt setting. For now, I enjoyed a glass of wine, which was chilled to perfection. And of course, I had tuna from Yamazaki. Hmm, maybe it's better to eat it in Ginza after all. So I ordered some fries! They weren't seasoned with salt, but they tasted great with a bit of soy sauce. All in all, I think it's a nice spot for enjoying good food and drinks solo during the afternoon at a reasonable price."
Delicious Edomae Sushi! A masterful touch from a top-tier restaurant! Truly impressive!,"At ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,"" you can enjoy authentic Edomae sushi in a casual style.The ingredients are always top-notch, sourced from famous wholesalers like Yamako in Toyosu.- Yamako Hon Maguro Akami - JPY 420Rich and moist in texture. I was able to savor this wonderful akami for such a great price.- Engawa Shio Aburi - JPY 420Engawa is best enjoyed aburi-style! The juicy umami bursts in your mouth.- Hon Maguro Nakaori Gunkan - JPY 620Just look at how beautiful it is. The flavor exceeded my expectations!- Aurora Salmon - JPY 420Consistently delicious, with no complaints.- Botan Ebi with Head - JPY 930Plump and full of sweetness, this shrimp has a rich umami that is simply perfect!- Hon Maguro Chutoro - JPY 620It melts in your mouth the moment you taste it! So delicious! I wanted to savor it longer, but it disappeared quickly!- Homemade Simmered Anago - JPY 620Among everything I tried, this simmered anago was my absolute favorite! It crumbled and had a fluffy texture. ItÅfs the best simmered anago I've had so far!- Creamy Shirako Tempura - JPY 930No smell at all and the flavor is creamy! The crispy batter reveals the melt-in-your-mouth shirako inside. Absolutely delicious!- Hishio Kishu Nankou Ume Hosomaki - JPY 320Perfect for a palate cleanser. The tartness of the plum refreshes your mouth. Very good!- Yamagobo Hosomaki - JPY 320If you eat it continuously, the yamagobo can be a bit salty. ItÅfs a fun dish with a nice crunchy texture.I think the concept of allowing many people to enjoy the high-end flavors in a casual style is wonderful! I definitely want to visit again. It was a great meal."
Hmm...?,"The last time I ate here, the flavor was truly top-notch.This time, I was left wondering...Since I've eaten here several times over different periods, I can tell it's possibly dropped in quality a bit. For this type of establishment, itÅfs still delicious, of course.Is it really that difficult to maintain quality?I noticed there were chairs for standing dining, so maybe thatÅfs a good sign?"
"December 24th, a sense of camaraderie.","It's quite a challenge for a second visit to surpass the excitement of the first. I found myself already getting accustomed to the experience, thinking, ""Oh, this is how it goes."" While the fish and rice quality at this kaiten sushi is top-notch, I didnÅft feel the same WOW factor as my first time.However, itÅfs still much better than going to a chain like Sushi Åõnmai.On bustling December 24th, I initially thought it was odd for two women to be gorging on sushi at a kaiten sushi place. But as I looked around, I spotted many fellow sushi lovers, which created a sense of camaraderie in this quirky kaiten sushi restaurant. Haha!I didnÅft manage to take photos of everything we ordered, but the seasonal kawahagi (filefish) was definitely delicious. I can't stress enough how tasty the food is at this price point, so letÅfs overlook minor issues.If I had to nitpick, the fish broth was a bit fishy. Perhaps it should be called a fish stew rather than a broth, as it contained a lot of salmon. I wouldÅfve liked to savor the broth a bit more.Next time, I'll try the standing sushi bar next door.It was a great meal."
New Concept at Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera!,"I visited on a Monday around 7:30 PM with a friend.There weren't many customers, so we were seated right away! However, many sushi items were sold out... (ÅLÅGÉ÷ÅG`) Ç§Ç£* Crab-flavored Salad Gunkan* Shrimp Mayo Gunkan* Toro-Taku* Hairtail Soup* California Roll, etc...Our total was JPY 4,420. We paid with a credit card.It might have been because we ordered some unconventional items, but it was quite affordable (**)Åô*ﬂThe rice was surprisingly delicious for a kaiten sushi restaurant! There were some areas for improvement, like not getting my coat back after checking it in, which might be due to insufficient staff training. But considering the casual prices, I can overlook these issues!As of December 2021, it has a Tabelog rating of 3.32!"
Upscale (Almost) Non-Rotating Sushi Restaurant,"I visited the Kaiten Sushi restaurant operated by Onodera, a high-end sushi spot that just opened in Omotesando.It's been featured on TV and has generated quite a buzz.Around noon on Saturday, there were four people ahead of me in line, but within 30 minutes, it grew to ten.Tama 120Yamakou Honmaguro Trio 1,750Homemade Kohada 320Mahata 620Ikawata No Okizuke (2 pieces) 320Live Kuruma Ebi 720Natural Buri (2 pieces) 510Total: JPY 4,360Since I was here, I decided to choose seasonal items and premium fish.The rice is made with red vinegar, and the fish portions are quite large, allowing me to fully enjoy their flavors.Personally, I felt the rice could be a bit more pronounced; I prefer when the sharp taste of red vinegar stands out even more.Particularly delicious items included:- Mahata: Surprisingly firm with a rich flavor. The texture is quite addictive!- Live Kuruma Ebi: The tail was still moving, indicating freshness, and it had a melt-in-your-mouth quality.- Natural Buri: The seasonal buri is exceptionally tasty this time of year, with just the right amount of fatit's no wonder the staff recommended it!ItÅfs a place that offers high-quality sushi without the pretentiousness, making it accessible for a quick yet satisfying meal.There arenÅft many places that can successfully fill this niche, and I think itÅfs great.Thank you for the wonderful meal!"

One piece of Yama-Sachi Hon Maguro Zuke, JPY 510 This red tuna marinated with the Yama-Sachi brand was exquisite, and I think it's probably the only conveyor belt sushi place where you can taste this quality! The marinade was decent, but the presence of the red vinegar sushi rice felt somewhat lacking.2. One piece of Yama-Sachi Hon Maguro O-Toro, JPY 930 This O-Toro, named after Yama-Sachi, was likely one of the highest-priced pieces of sushi I've had at a conveyor belt restaurant! The topping was delicious.3. One piece of homemade Kohada, JPY 320 The balancing of flavors was excellent!4. Two pieces of Hokkaido live octopus, JPY 420 I enjoyed the unique texture combined with the momiji-oroshi (grated daikon radish) accent.5. Two pieces of squid with yuzu salt, JPY 420 The pairing with yuzu salt was delightful.6. Two pieces of live Miru shellfish, JPY 510 I enjoyed the crunchy texture and the rich marine flavor.7. Two pieces of Akagai (red clam) nigiri, JPY 720 I love red clam, but this particular serving didn't quite meet my expectations.8. Two pieces of sprout green onion, JPY 320 Surprisingly deliciousI really liked it!9. Chawanmushi (steamed egg custard) with snow crab and roe, JPY 720 I ordered a dish from the a la carte menu. I would have preferred a stronger dashi flavor, but it was tasty.10. Two pieces of corn mayo gunkan, JPY 210I tried something you definitely wouldnÅft find in a high-end restaurant. I quite liked it!11. One piece of live Shima-aji (striped jack), JPY 420 This Shima-aji was tasty!12. One piece of house-made steamed shrimp, JPY 420 I'm sorry, but this didn't suit my taste at all.13. Two pieces of Aurora salmon, JPY 420I went for the popular conveyor belt sushi topping. It was rich and delicious.14. One piece of homemade boiled anago, JPY 620I thought it was good, but the quality did differ quite a bit from high-end restaurants.15. Ise Shima Aosa soup, JPY 320A nice way to finish off the meal.The total bill was JPY 7,900. I couldn't quite determine if that was expensive or affordable, as it was my first visit!"
"December 24th, a sense of camaraderie.","It's quite a challenge for a second visit to surpass the excitement of the first. I found myself already getting accustomed to the experience, thinking, ""Oh, this is how it goes."" While the fish and rice quality at this kaiten sushi is top-notch, I didnÅft feel the same WOW factor as my first time.However, itÅfs still much better than going to a chain like Sushi Åõnmai.On bustling December 24th, I initially thought it was odd for two women to be gorging on sushi at a kaiten sushi place. But as I looked around, I spotted many fellow sushi lovers, which created a sense of camaraderie in this quirky kaiten sushi restaurant. Haha!I didnÅft manage to take photos of everything we ordered, but the seasonal kawahagi (filefish) was definitely delicious. I can't stress enough how tasty the food is at this price point, so letÅfs overlook minor issues.If I had to nitpick, the fish broth was a bit fishy. Perhaps it should be called a fish stew rather than a broth, as it contained a lot of salmon. I wouldÅfve liked to savor the broth a bit more.Next time, I'll try the standing sushi bar next door.It was a great meal."
The character for food means to improve people; it signifies their betterment. @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,"""The conveyor has stopped, haha, at Kaiten Sushi Onodera""In recent years, the Onodera Group has gained a reputation by collaborating with Yamatsuki to procure the first tuna of the new year (Ichiban Maguro). This location combines Kaiten (conveyor belt) sushi and standing sushi bar in one place, which is situated in Omotesando. While strolling down Omotesando, I suddenly remembered and decided to visit for the first time since its opening.Despite being just before dinner peak time, there were already more than ten groups of foreigners waiting, haha. Still, I was able to enter relatively smoothly.ÅyAtmosphere of the restaurantÅzAs usual, it gives off a ""luxurious"" rather than ""high-end"" vibe, and it seems to cater to foreign customers, haha. After being seated, I was surprised to find that the familiar conveyor belt was not operating. Upon inquiring, I learned that they had changed from the conveyor belt system to a more traditional plate service style. The concept has shifted, haha...While such a comment may seem unnecessary, it seems like it turned out fine, haha. The reason for this change is that about 70% of the customers are foreigners, and it was also considered from a hygiene standpoint.ÅyOrder details at Kaiten Sushi OnoderaÅz Flatfish (JPY 350). Åõ Squid (JPY 300). Åõ Yamatsuki Hon Maguro Assorted (Otoro, Chutoro, Akami) (JPY 2000). Åõ Purple Sea Urchin (JPY 1100). Åõ Sprout Negi (JPY 210). Åõ Aosa Seaweed Soup from Ise-Shima (JPY 350). Å¢ Kanpyo Hosomaki (JPY 370). Å¢ Homemade Castella Egg (JPY 320). ÅõÅyFood impressionsÅzThe ""Tekka Maki"" I ordered was sold out,In the end, my total came to around JPY 5000, and considering the content, I think it was a good price. In terms of the sushi's quality, I believe it rivals the recently popular high-end standing sushi bars that charge between JPY 7000 and JPY 10000, thanks to their strong procurement power. However, since there are many customers, the execution was a bit messy. For example... while the red vinegar rice was on the smaller side, the cuts of fish varied significantly.If they could ensure a more uniform size and thickness, it would improve the overall experience.Additionally, the kanpyo was quite bland, and yet the wasabiÅfs sharpness was overwhelmingly strong, so it might be better to change the wasabi.ÅyServiceÅzThere was a new entertainment element introduced, where staff enthusiastically shout encouragement when serving drinks and dishes, which seems aimed at foreign customers. I couldn't help but worry, wondering what they would think of Japanese sushi!ÅyMiscellaneousÅzKaiten Sushi Onodera in Omotesando is thriving, recognized globally by foreigners. From a management perspective, my imagination suggests...that with an average customer spending of around JPY 6000, and assuming they receive between 250 and 300 customers daily, the monthly revenue would approximate JPY 40 million to JPY 50 million.It was a great meal!Åy(Revised) Personal evaluation points from 2025Åz(1) Due to recent trends in Tabelog, I find it increasingly hard to write honestly, so from 2025, I will evaluate dishes separately on a 3-point scale based on preference rather than good or bad. Åù Very Much to My LikingÅõ To My Liking or Close to My LikingÅ¢ Corresponding to Price or Not My Liking(2) Regarding overall scoring, starting in 2025, I will revise it as follows:3.0-3.4 is somewhat deviating from my preference.3.5-3.9 indicates a good restaurant with potential for repeat visits.4.0-4.4 indicates great satisfaction and certain repeat visitation.4.5-5.0 indicates a desire to visit at least four times a year.*Evaluation criteria may change in the future.Thank you for reading to the end. I would appreciate your likes, follows, and saving of the restaurant. Thank you very much!"
Omotesando,"Recently, I've been working around Omotesando and exploring the area.I finished work early and went to Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera with my colleagues.Even though it was around 6 PM, we were able to get a table right away.I forgot to take pictures, but ordering is easy through a touch panel.The chefsÅf banter is enjoyable, and everything I've eaten is delicious.Although it's not the cheapest option, I find it accessible and enjoyable as it's conveyor belt sushi.I appreciate being able to see the prices, which brings peace of mind.I would love to visit again in this stylish interior!

Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera serves delicious authentic tuna from Yamako,"Located about a 2-minute walk from Omotesando Station, Ginza Onodera's kaiten sushi concept opened in October 2021.Yama Ko's Luxurious Three Pieces of Bluefin Tuna (JPY 1,450)Live Sweet Shrimp (JPY 720)Freshly Caught Japanese Amberjack (JPY 510)Aurora Salmon (JPY 420)Yama Ko's Medium Fatty Bluefin Tuna Gunkan (JPY 510)Fresh Snow Crab (JPY 510)Special Sea Urchin Gunkan (JPY 930)Shredded Kishu Nanko Ume Roll (JPY 320)The quality as a kaiten sushi restaurant is exceptional, scoring 120 points.However, I believe what's crucial for a kaiten sushi experience are the serving times and cost performance.The timing is spot on. Though itÅfs kaiten sushi, it wasnÅft rotating at that time, meaning we got freshly made sushi right after ordering.The cost performance is somewhat lacking, coming to around JPY 6,000 per person. For that price, there are lunch course options available at other places.Still, I could feel the commitment to quality, especially with the use of Yama Ko's bluefin tuna and the high level of the ingredients.It was a great meal. I highly recommend visiting!"
"Just a 1-minute walk from Omotesando Station A1 Exit, opened on October 8, 2021, Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, a Michelin-starred establishment.","(November 24, 2021)The renowned restaurant 'Ginza Onodera' opened a kaiten sushi (conveyor belt sushi) location in Omotesando on the 8th of last month. I wanted to visit as soon as possible, but since it is a Michelin-starred restaurant offering sushi at kaiten sushi prices, many customers have been flooding in.Thinking the initial rush might have calmed down, I visited after running some errands around 14:30. To my surprise, I was able to enter without waiting, and since it was a quieter time, we were allowed to use a table even though there were just two of us.The stylish interior, without being overly flashy, exudes an air of elegance, and the spacious layout allows for a relaxed dining experience.During my visit, I was served 'Kanpachi', which was just filleted, and 'Katsu Jime Tai' as advertised on the conveyor belt. I savored the deliciousness of the firm white fish.Next up was 'Mujoka Namazaba', a brand of mackerel farmed in Kagoshima. Because its feed is carefully managed, there is little concern for the parasite Anisakis. Not long ago, this 'Namazaba' could only be enjoyed in Kyushu, but now you can savor the sweet freshness of live mackerel right in the city.Then came the tuna. I was delighted to find that I could enjoy premium fatty tuna from 'Yama Ko', which won the top bid for tuna at the first auction of the year at Toyosu Market, all at a reasonable price. I enjoyed the rich flavor and umami of the red meat and the melt-in-your-mouth texture of the medium fatty tuna.The steamed shrimp provided a satisfying texture and flavor, and the large scallops were sweet and delicious.However, my excitement was slightly dampened when I realized that the snow crab was not served 'live' as I had naively expected.I also enjoyed a total of 11 pieces of sushi, including salmon, kohada, and live turban shell, along with a soup. Since I was already full, I completely forgot to order the simmered eel. I was very satisfied with the bill, which came to just under JPY 4,000."
No.1 Gourmet Kaiten Sushi,"I visited here after a while because the standing sushi shop next door was closed.The conveyor is still running, but the sushi isn't moving.This time, I ordered:- Maokarei (2 pieces)- Ishigakigai (2 pieces)- Salmon (1 piece)- Flounder Engawa (2 pieces)- Sardine (2 pieces)- Nakaochi Gunkan (Tuna) (2 pieces)- Nakaochi Gunkan (Salmon) (2 pieces)- Yariika (2 pieces)- Toro-Taku Roll- Chutoro (1 piece)- Ara Soup- Taito (Japanese sake)And more.I ended up eating quite a lot. As a fan of fatty fish, I found the salmon, engawa, sardine, and chutoro to be the best.Each had a rich fattiness that melted in my mouth.Seasonal items like Ishigakigai and Maokarei were also fresh and delicious.My favorite here is the ara soup. ItÅfs loaded with meaty pieces from the fish bones and has no unpleasant odorjust wonderful.When you order the Taito sake, all the staff come together to cheer. This is a signature experience of the restaurant, so I recommend trying it at least once. It really lifts your spirits.For me, this is the No.1 gourmet kaiten sushi.It was a great meal!"
Solo Sushi and Quick Bites,"This is a kaiten sushi restaurant created by the renowned Ginza Onodera.It is conveniently located near Omotesando Station and offers a spacious interior, including private rooms which are rare for kaiten sushi.This place is perfect when you want to enjoy sushi quickly but at a certain level of quality!It's definitely a restaurant worth knowing about. "
"Enjoying plenty of ""Taito"" Japanese Sake served in a masu, along with fresh tuna from Yamakou","On this day, I visited 'Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera' located in Omotesando.This esteemed sushi restaurant, which has been awarded a Michelin star, opened its kaiten sushi and standing sushi bar in October 2021.When I arrived around 11:20 AM on Saturday, I was informed that there was about a 30-minute wait for the sit-down sushi. Meanwhile, there was no line for the standing sushi, but I decided to wait inside for a seat.In fact, I was seated at the counter in about 20 minutes.The restaurant is clean and spacious, creating a pleasant sense of openness. Although the sushi conveyor belt is operating, sushi does not flow on it. Instead, you can place orders using a touch panel, and the chef prepares the sushi and hands you the plate directly.For sake, they offer Dassai, and for shochu, they have Mori Izo. After some thought, I decided to go for the recommended sake, 'Taiho'.Soon after, a chef brought a large bottle and filled my glassserved generously to the brim of the masu (sake cup)with his enthusiastic greeting. It was a delightful surprise.I quickly started ordering appetizers and sushi through the touch panel:Å° Shirako PonzuÅ° Squid Intestines in Soy SauceThese were enough to pair with my sake. I was already excited from the start.Å° Sea BreamÅ° Sprouted LeeksÅ° House-made Steamed ShrimpÅ° Thick Live ScallopThe scallop was incredibly thick, fresh, and sweetdelicious!Å° House-made KohadaÅ° Aurora Salmon Nakaochi GunkanÅ° Yamako Hon Maguro AkamiÅ° Yamako Hon Maguro Akami MarinatedÅ° Yamako Hon Maguro ChutoroÅ° Yamako Hon Maguro Nakaochi GunkanThe tuna from Yamako truly was superb. In particular, the Hon Maguro Nakaochi Gunkan was creamy and packed with flavor!Å° Wild YellowtailAt this point, a demonstration of butchering a winter yellowtail began, and the chef showcased a large winter yellowtail. When I quickly ordered a plate, it was rich in fat, fresh, and delicious!Å° Chawanmushi (Savory Egg Custard)Å° Flamed Engawa (Fluke Fin)Å° Anago (Sea Eel)The anago was fluffy and melted in my mouth the moment I took a bite. It was a blissful taste!Å° Toro-Taku Hosomaki (Fatty Tuna and Pickled Radish Roll)Å° House-made CastellaWith all that I ate, it came to about JPY 9,000, which was quite satisfying. I would love to return regularly. It was a great meal."
"High-end Michelin-starred Kaiten Sushi featuring exquisite ""Yamakou Hon Maguro"" and reasonably priced ""Kids Sushi""","The ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch"" opened on October 8 in Omotesando.This is a new concept of ""Ginza Onodera,"" which has received Michelin stars for its sushi and French cuisine both domestically and internationally.Located just off Omotesando, it's a 1-2 minute walk from Exit A1 of Omotesando Station.The right side features the ""Tachikui Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch,"" while the left side is dedicated to the ""Kaiten Sushi"" area.The interior seems to only have counter seating, spacious and luxurious with plenty of staff.It has a feeling of luxury, yet the staff's energetic demeanor gives it a pleasantly casual vibe typical of a kaiten sushi place.Although itÅfs a kaiten sushi, the sushi doesnÅft move on a conveyor belt; instead, itÅfs freshly prepared and handed over as ordered via a touchscreen panel.The plates are also used for billing, which gives it a kaiten sushi feel.The menu is quite extensive, featuring assorted nigiri, rolls, and side dishes, with sushi starting from the 200 JPY range, but most options seem to be in the 300 to 500 JPY range.The drink selection is impressive for a kaiten sushi, with a variety of beers, highballs, Japanese sake, shochu, and wine.They only serve draft beer, but the lineup of options like Isojimanjyu, Mori Izo, and champagne is sure to please any beverage enthusiast.Among the many toppings, the most notable is the ""Hon Maguro"" from the tuna dealer ""Yamakou.""They offer 4 kinds: otoro (fatty tuna), chutoro (medium fatty tuna), akami (red meat), and marinated tuna, available from a single piece.""Yamakou Hon Maguro Akami, 1 piece"" - 320 JPYYou can choose the portion of rice from the touchscreen, so I selected a smaller amount.The beautiful red meat clearly stands out in quality.Upon tasting, it was moist, finely textured, and silky.It felt a bit aged, and the slight chewiness was irresistible.""Yamakou Hon Maguro Akami Zuke, 1 piece"" - 420 JPYThis version had an increased stickiness and deeper umami flavor.Like the akami, it was also thickly sliced, providing a full-bodied experience, and the slightly stronger red vinegar rice was excellent.""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera 3 Piece Assortment (Kinmedai, Natural Buri, Hirame)"" - 930 JPYThis weekend-only menu features larger pieces for all toppings.The chewy hirame, kinmedai, and richly fatty natural buri were all satisfying.""Live Hokkigai, 2 pieces"" - 510 JPYThis consisted of 2 pieces, including the body and strip, which were a bit smaller.While they had some sweetness and weren't bad, they felt average compared to the tuna and white fish.""Yamakou Hon Maguro Chutoro, 1 piece"" - 510 JPYAnother stunning piece of tuna.The deliciousness of the fat melting on the tongue was remarkable.""Kids Sushi"" - 720 JPYUnlike high-end sushi restaurants, itÅfs evident that they are targeting family customers with this menu.This includes half-size sushi of tuna, shrimp, and salmon in 6 pieces, along with fried chicken, French fries, and 2 cakes, providing excellent value.Even the kids' sushi includes tuna from Yamakou (this place only uses Yamakou tuna).The salmon with ikura and the cakes were reportedly delicious, and the freshly fried chicken served as a great snack.Since this is a Michelin-starred restaurant in a kaiten sushi format, I noticed mixed reactions during its early days.From my experience, the preparation didn't reach the level of high-end sushi; perhaps the slightly elevated price as a kaiten sushi was a point of contention.I approached it with an understanding of the prices and ambiance after reading various opinions, so I enjoyed it just fine as a kaiten sushi.However, even with the touchscreen ordering system, I had to remind them twice for one of my orders, so that aspect could definitely be improved.Additionally, itÅfs certainly on the pricier side compared to other gourmet kaiten sushi places, and ordering too freely can lead to unexpectedly high bills.However, considering the location in upscale Omotesando, many might want to enjoy delicious sushi even at a higher price.Personally, I think ordering something like the ""Dassai"" for around 1230 JPY and sampling some quality toppings would be ideal.While there may be variations in quality among the items, the ""Yamakou Hon Maguro"" is a luxurious treat even kids can appreciate.I can only say it's fantastic to be able to enjoy this tuna with childrenitÅfs definitely a must-try!"
Stylish Kaiten Sushi in Omotesando,"On a Saturday night in Omotesando, I visited a stylish new kaiten sushi restaurant. Since reservations arenÅft available, I headed straight to the restaurant and was pleased to be seated without a wait. The interior was bright and exuded a sense of luxury. For drinks, I chose Aitakuno Matsuyama sake from Miyagi. Ordering was done through a touchscreen. I started with premium tuna belly, followed by engawa (fluke fin), fresh aomori clams, sweet shrimp, konbu kelp with roe, steamed shrimp, and fresh mackerel.The gunkan series included gunkan with crab miso, boiled shirasu (young sardine), shiro-uo (white fish), and crab-flavored salad gunkan. Each ingredient had its origin written, making selection enjoyable. My companions ordered their favorite nigiri, along with a torotaku (fatty tuna and takuan radish) roll and chawanmushi with snow crab and salmon roe. To finish, we also tried the house-made castella egg and crme brle. The rice is relatively small, so we kept eating more. For two people enjoying our preferred selections, we each spent about JPY 5000. ItÅfs a bit pricey for kaiten sushi, but itÅfs a nice treat every once in a while."
"Conveyor Belt Sushi Without the Conveyor! Enjoyed 13 pieces including premium Bluefin Tuna and wild Yellowtail, along with fried chicken and fish soup for just JPY 4,500such a great price! As expected from Michelin-starred Onodera! Surprisingly, the fried chicken was a highlight! (^^)v","Michelin-starred sushi restaurant ""Ginza Onodera"" has opened a kaiten sushi (conveyor belt sushi) location in Omotesando.The restaurant opened on October 8, and right next door, the ""Tachikui Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch"" also opened on the same day. Additionally, on October 22, the ""Sushi Ginza Onodera Second Main Branch"" opened in Futako-Tamagawa, marking three openings in October.Both restaurants are designed to be casual and affordable.The kaiten sushi is located just a 2-minute walk from Omotesando Station, accessible via the Tokyo Metro Hanzomon Line, Ginza Line, and Chiyoda Line.Business hours are from 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM (last entry at 8:00 PM, last order at 8:30 PM). *Note: There is a capacity limit from 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM.I visited around 1 PM as a solo diner.After a short wait, I was seated.The restaurant has about 30 counter seats, four tables for four people, two tables for six people, making a total of around 55 seats. *Private rooms are available for 2 to 12 guests.I indulged in kaiten sushi perfected under the complete supervision of Executive Chef Akihumi Sakagami from ""Sushi Ginza Onodera"" Åc Ordering was done via a tablet, and of course, I served myself tea from an automatic tea dispenser.First, I started with the tunaÅc The renowned true tuna from Toyosu's famous wholesaler ""Yama K"".In January of this year, I won the bid for the most prized tuna at the first auction held at Toyosu market.- True tuna, fatty toro, 1 piece (JPY 720, tax included)Absolutely delicious! So tender! Is JPY 720 a fair price?Other items includeÅc- Nakaochi (belly) of Aurora salmon, 2 pieces (JPY 420, tax included)- Wild buri (yellowtail), 2 pieces (JPY 510, tax included)- Fried young chicken (JPY 420, tax included)- Aurora salmon harami (belly), 1 piece (JPY 320, tax included)- Live octopus from Hokkaido, 2 pieces (JPY 420, tax included)- Tuna salad gunkan, 2 pieces (JPY 210, tax included)- Handmade ikura (salmon roe) gunkan, 2 pieces (JPY 510, tax included)- Homemade simmered anago (sea eel) (JPY 620, tax included)- Homemade clear soup (JPY 420, tax included)Total cost was about JPY 4,500.Åô Review Åc I was surprised that itÅfs a kaiten sushi but it doesnÅft actually rotate. As expected of a Michelin restaurant! Even though itÅfs called kaiten sushi, they donÅft actually rotate the sushi! Amazing! I had a total of 13 pieces and ordered fried chicken and clear soup for JPY 4,500! Considering the ingredients, it feels quite inexpensive. It felt like I had eaten more than I actually did, making it feel even more affordable. However, the biggest surprise was the fried chicken! Does ""Onodera"" also serve tempura?! The batter was crisp and incredibly delicious, and the meat was tender and juicytruly delightful! Even though it's called kaiten sushi, itÅfs ""Onodera."" I was able to enjoy fried chicken like at a high-end restaurant.Of course, the sushi was also delicious. The fried chicken was so good (^o^;)Thank you for the meal.I will definitely visit again."
Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Opens in Ginza,"I heard the rumor that Onodera has opened a kaiten sushi restaurant, so I visited with my family.Despite it being around 5:30 PM, the place was nearly full, and there were about three groups waiting after we arrived.Family-friendly with sofa seating available.The prices are slightly higher than the usual kaiten sushi spots, but if the service quality matches, I would be satisfied. However, it seemed there were a few staff members, making things feel a bit hectic.They also offer a kids' set, which is quite a deal, priced at around JPY 700. I think it would be more than enough for children under five!Though it seems they have many challenges since they just opened, I rated them with great expectations. I will visit again."

Everything was delicious today except for the mackerel.,"I initially planned to visit a hamburger place called ""Yosh"" that just opened on the 16th, but it was temporarily closed, so I headed towards Omotesando Hills. On the way, I remembered that I hadnÅft been to ""Onodera"" in a while, so I decided to drop by.I was able to enter without waiting. HereÅfs what I ordered, in the order they were served:- 2 pieces of Shima Aji (JPY 650) - Delicious!- 2 pieces of Shime Saba (JPY 440) - Unfortunately, the Shime Saba was disappointing again. The last time, the fish wasnÅft great either...- 1 piece of Kohada (JPY 340) - The Kohada today was quite good.- 1 piece of Mackerel (JPY 280) - The mackerel was decent today.- 1 piece of Horse Mackerel (JPY 280) - The horse mackerel was excellent today.- 1 piece of Simmered Anago (JPY 640) - I believe this was my first time having the simmered anago here, and it was soft and flavorful, well-prepared with a rich glaze.- 2 pieces of Medium Fatty Tuna (JPY 620) - Was it about the size of a medium one? It had a relatively light flavor, which is understandable for tuna in March.- 1 Tuna Toro Takumaki (JPY 720) - It was okay.As I mentioned during my first visit, the sushi rice uses red vinegar, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. While the Shime Saba didnÅft impress, the other fish was better than last time, and the anago exceeded my expectations.Spending JPY 3970 for lunch is certainly not cheap, but worthwhile."
Casual enjoyment at a renowned sushi restaurant in Ginza,"This is Yoshio from Left Side Back Amore.I took a detour to get here.Rolling the VTR!From Ginza to the world! With such great ambitions, Ginza Onodera is also expanding overseas.There is a different style of this restaurant located in Jingumae.The Kaiten and the standing sushi are in the same building. Having walked through Omotesando Hills, I was tired and headed to the Kaiten.Starting with Yamakou's tuna, they use the same ingredients as the Ginza location, offering incredible cost performance.Although itÅfs a kaiten sushi, you place your order via a touch panel, so you won't have to eat dry pieces, and after you enjoy five plates, you wonÅft have to play a gacha game.This place is accessible for everyone and will surely become popular!"
Visited for 2 consecutive weeks since opening,"On the Grand Opening day, I visited around 7 PM after work. I told my name to the cashier and receptionist, and when I asked about the waiting time, it was approximately 45 minutes. I anticipated an early closing due to running out of ingredients, but the wait was surprisingly short. Plus, there was an empty spot in the waiting area. Most groups were two or more people, making me, as a solo diner, feel a bit outnumbered. To my surprise, there were few congratulatory flowers from celebrities, with more names related to business. They invited media representatives for a pre-opening and opened boldly with glowing online reviews as their weapon.The highlight of the opening was the premium tuna from Toyosu Nakauchi Yamakou, with prices for the different cuts listed as follows: Otoro (fatty tuna) for 720  420, Chutoro (medium fatty tuna) for 510  280, and Akami (red meat) for 320  210.Even for a conveyor belt sushi, these prices were reasonable for the quality that typically isn't easily accessible. I tried red rice for the first time and found it to be more aromatic compared to regular white rice. I enjoyed two pieces each of otoro, chutoro, and akami in that order, and each was delicious. The otoro was rich with sweet fat yet had a firm texture and distinctive flavor.Moreover, the tuna pieces were artistically sliced on the surface to enhance the flavor, showcasing the craftsmanship worthy of Michelin recognition. Afterwards, I had two more pieces of otoro, marinated akami, two pieces of nakaochi gunkan, a roll with torutaku (tuna and mountain yam), and finished with homemade castella-style egg. Everything was satisfying in taste. I wonder if they can keep these prices for longer than the advertised three-day campaign.The draft beer at 750 is on the expensive side.I plan to visit a standing sushi bar tomorrow."
"Expensive for a conveyor belt sushi, but perhaps a bargain for Onodera's sushi...","Å¶ This is a critical review.I heard that there's a wait, so I arrived just after 10 AM on a weekday. There were two groups ahead of me, and by the time it was past 11 AM, the line had grown quite a bit.They opened at 11:30, and I was able to get in on the first round without any trouble! There were plenty of seats at the counter and in booths, and everyone who had lined up before opening managed to get in during the first round.Since it was the grand opening, I received a brief explanation about that and then ordered my favorite sushi using the touch panel.After the first piece arrived, I waited quite a while for the next sushi to come (laughs). I had to wait about 10 minutes for the next piece. Even though my order was in, I sometimes received items I hadn't ordered or things I had ordered arrived much later...Well, considering it's a brand new opening, it's understandable that the operation isn't running smoothly...That said, there were way too few chefs for the number of seats! Yet everyone seemed relaxed and was chatting, which concerned me quite a bit!As for the sushi itself, there were delicious pieces like the shrimp, shellfish, and shima-aji, but there were also some that made me go, 'hmm'especially the tuna, which seemed clearly frozen. I couldn't help but wonder if it was really from Yamakou...Honestly, I think itÅfs enough to go there once. It was a great meal!"
Kaiten Sushi in Omotesando! Beautiful interior!,"I heard that the famous Michelin-starred ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" has started offering conveyor belt sushi in Omotesando!Oh no?! It's showing fully booked today!! Wait, what a shock... But then I found out it was the ""Standing Sushi Ginza Onodera"" that was fully booked! What a relief! Haha.Upon entering, the interior is spacious and gorgeous!I'm so happy that I can choose the smaller rice portion!The selected uni from the special uni bowl was delicious with no unpleasant odor! Amazing!!I ended up ordering two of them! The mackerel was also fresh!!The only disappointment was the fatty tuna. It had a bit of a chewy texture. My friend shared the same opinion.The cooked fish soup was consistently delicious! The crab and salmon roe chawanmushi along with the squid tentacles were superb!!I felt a slight odor in the sea snail, so even though I love shellfish, I decided to stick to just one plate this time!The homemade marinated mackerel wrapped in kombu was flavorful! The price range is a bit on the high end, typical of high-class conveyor belt sushi!Given the location, maybe that's perfectly fine! The freshness is outstanding!And the portions are generous!There werenÅft any sushi on the conveyor belt.I couldn't help but think it was a waste not to use the conveyor to display the sushi! Haha.Maybe itÅfs to create the conveyor belt sushi atmosphere?I wished there were some 4-person tables for families, and then I noticed there were private rooms in the back while heading to the restroom. I appreciated the thick towels provided! Sorry if I'm being a bit demanding! Haha.It was delicious!It was a great meal!!"
Eat for free or pay to eat?,"I wonder if it's really worth paying for this myself. It seems like it's fine for those who get invited to promote it. The tuna is delicious, but there are quite a few questionable items on the menu, and a lot of frozen fish as well. If you're excited to experience high-end kaiten sushi in Ginza, you might be disappointed. The offerings lean towards what you'd typically find at a kaiten sushi restaurant, including the menu items. Using red vinegar might give it an air of uniqueness, but it mostly caters to general tastes without much flavor distinction. I think for a kaiten sushi place, that's acceptable. However, if they're promoting their homemade kohada or anago, they could do better, as the anago had a strong fishy smell. The small tuna rolls didn't have enough filling, and the way the shrimp was steamed was puzzling. When you think of kaiten sushi, you usually think of salad gunkanmaki, and honestly, this place couldn't compete with bigger chains. The tuna was the standout, and while shellfish and other types of sushi were fine, it's only expected considering the prices. To be honest, if I'm paying this price, I'd rather have sushi from Sushiro. I actually think Sushiro is amazing. Good tuna makes you feel like you spent a lot when you eat it this way. If itÅfs the same price, I'd prefer standing sushi places like Akira or similar ones that provide better quality, even if they donÅft have a conveyor belt."
Kaiten Sushi Onodera is now open! Discover what sets it apart from traditional conveyor belt sushi and what remains the same...,"Located near the Omotesando Crossing, on the opposite side of the street from Ito Hospital, you'll find Onodera's new concept featuring Kaiten Sushi and standing sushi. I decided to try the Kaiten Sushi.It was busy, though IÅfm unsure if it was just due to the opening. I arrived right at the opening time, so I ended up waiting for the second rotation. After signing my name, I was told it would take an hour, so I stepped away for a bit. I returned an hour later, waited a little, and was seated around 12:30.As for the sushi, I ordered using the touch panels, as is typical for conveyor belt sushi. IÅfd like to comment on the operation first: The touch panel response was poor, and there were quite a few items marked as sold out or not ready, even during lunch hours. The staff seemed inexperienced, as I almost received multiple orders of the same items, and some took a long time to arrive. There was also an announcement after the bill inviting patrons to try items not listed on the menu, which I wish had been mentioned earlier.In terms of operation, there are certainly more refined practices in established conveyor belt sushi places, and it seems they're still getting used to the concept. I look forward to their improvement in the future. However, all the staff were cheerful and showed great customer service, sometimes joking around, which created a vibrant and pleasant atmosphere.Now, regarding the sushi itself, it was decent. But I couldnÅft help but think the price was only justified in Omotesando or maybe overseas. The tuna from Yamayuki, served in various cuts like akami, chutoro, and otoro, as well as warship sushi, are quite good quality and not something youÅfd typically find in conveyor belt sushi, but the prices have completely surpassed the norm for kaiten sushi (though today, during their opening sale, Yamayuki's tuna was half price).The cuts and rice were somewhat typical of conveyor belt sushi, with a noticeable roughness and dryness. The rice was large and combined with juicy toppings, making for a somewhat overwhelming experience. On the bright side, the beer was perfect and worth the price! The wine selection was also impressive, carefully chosen to pair well with the sushi. Japanese sake and shochu (including Moriizu!) were also available, which could appeal to international patrons.Next, IÅfd like to try the standing sushi."
"Not in Ginza, but Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch","Not in Ginza, but I visited Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera.This is a new style from the Onodera group in Ginza. They have a waiting list system which gives you an estimated return time, so you can relax in the meantime.I heard that there used to be a caf in this location, also managed by the Onodera Group, but the space is incredibly spacious.The lighting and decor are beautiful, making it hard to believe itÅfs a conveyor belt sushi restaurant.The bright interior is welcoming, even for solo female diners.You can order your preferred items using the touch panel in front of you. You can also select the size of the rice and whether or not you want wasabi.I eagerly awaited the sushi, starting with Yamazuki's premium bluefin tuna: akami, chutoro, and otoro.Notably, the sushi rice is made with red vinegar, which is a first for me at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant.The cutting is a bit rough at times, but the quality of the ingredients shines through, making it very delicious. The level of fat in the fish is fantastic.The sea urchin, which has been increasing in price this year, arrived in a beautiful dish and was delightfully rich and sweet!While the prices for each item are on the higher side for conveyor belt sushi, they are quite satisfying overall.I wonder how many regulars they will attract at this price point, given the location.Next time, I would like to stop by solo for a casual visit.Instagram: lunchkirakira (Ginza Lunch)https://www.instagram.com/lunchkirakira/?hl=jaI just surpassed 19,000 followers!"
A New Concept at Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,"I visited on the second day of the grand opening. It was just after opening, but they had run out of kohada (young sardine), scallops, and turban shell, which was a bit disappointing. While the quality of the ingredients was generally good, I felt that the price did not match the value of items like flounder, chu-toro (medium fatty tuna), o-toro (fatty tuna), and botan shrimp. With the new format in place, I understand that there will be some initial hiccups during the opening.Perhaps things will smooth out after a month. I look forward to my next visit."
Grand Opening Special: Half Price Tuna at Yamako!?,"Kaiten Sushi Onodera has just opened in Omotesando. The entrance is adorned with an unexpected abundance of flowers. It's just a short walk from Omotesando Station! To celebrate the opening, they are offering half-price Yamazaki tuna.I couldn't resist, so I visited on the first day. Although it's labeled as a conveyor-belt sushi restaurant, you can order via a touch panel and the sushi will be prepared right in front of you. The touch panel allows you to choose the size of the rice and even opt for no wasabi, making it very accommodating for women and families. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is lively and enjoyable! Both the rice and the toppings are incredibly deliciousfar beyond what you'd expect from a conveyor-belt sushi restaurant! Being able to enjoy such tasty sushi so easily is simply the best. I look forward to coming back for the second round. It was a great meal!"
Enjoying Sake at Kaiten Sushi,"ÅyKaiten Sushi Ginza OnoderaÅzGinzaÅfs renowned Onodera has surprisingly launched a kaiten sushi (conveyor belt sushi) venture, just a 5-minute walk from Omotesando Station.ItÅfs fantastic to enjoy expertly crafted sushi topped with thoughtfully prepared ingredients over a base of vinegared rice seasoned with red vinegar. It undoubtedly ranks among the highest quality kaiten sushi.I visited on opening day and faced a long wait to get in, but it seems to have calmed down now, allowing for quicker access."
"Delicious Sushi: Second Visit to Omotesando ""Onodera""","This is the kaiten sushi version of Ginza Onodera, located in Omotesando.It's positioned as a budget-friendly optiona perfect introduction to the gourmet sushi experience, and it's certainly delicious!On this day, they had just acquired some fresh tuna at auction, and when we were seated, they handed us an ""order ticket"" and asked, ""Would you like to place your order now?"" Naturally, we did, and it was delicious.While the sushi is tasty, the variety of toppings is somewhat limited.The sushi is made without using seasoned soy sauce, so the rice has a nice flavor on its own.Most pieces are around JPY 400 each.The most expensive was the uni (sea urchin) at JPY 800, I believe.Reservations are not accepted.There is a ticket machine in front of the restaurant where you check in.I was told it would be a one-hour wait, but it was actually about 30 minutes.There are lanes, but they weren't busy at all.The restaurant is spacious and very clean.Despite its size, there are few seats, making it feel quite comfortable.Expect your budget to be around JPY 5000 to JPY 7000 per person.Given this, it's a great way to enjoy the atmosphere of a high-end establishment."
Enjoyed the finest tuna,"I happened to walk by and saw that they were accepting reservations through an iPad for the top-quality tuna, so I made a booking. Fortunately, I could enter on the first round. When I arrived at 1:30 PM for the opening, there were many reporters and customers lined up outside. The opening was delayed by over 20 minutes, but the atmosphere inside was lively and pleasant. Of course, there were reporters asking if they could take pictures of us while we ate, which was a no-go, but I ended up on TV when they showed the overall scene. I could only have two pieces of the top-quality tuna as an individual, but it was undeniably delicious. Additionally, I enjoyed delicious seafood like shirako (cod milt) and buri (yellowtail) paired with Japanese sake and sparkling wine."
A conveyor sushi restaurant with high-quality ingredients,"On a Saturday afternoon, I visited using the EPARK reservation system. It's a well-designed system, but predicting the wait time is difficult as the number of waiting parties can suddenly decrease or not decrease at all. This is something to accept.The staff and chefs provided excellent service, leaving a good impression. There were many chefs, and I didn't have to wait long for my orders, which was also a positive experience.The sushi toppings were great, as expected from a high-end chain, and there was no comparison to regular conveyor belt sushi. However, the skill levels of the chefs varied. Some seemed to be inexperienced while others were seasoned and skilled. Overall, the sushi was prepared with a sense of urgency, and few chefs took their time to craft each piece.Since I was drinking, I switched from sushi to sashimi for my order midway through. By the way, ordering sashimi is possible through the tablet system, which is very convenient.I ordered tempura with squid, but it was quite disappointing. It was more like fried food rather than tempura. IÅfd say the tempura at Kurazushi is better. ItÅfs disheartening that a high-end restaurant would serve tempura that is worse than what a machine can produce. What a shame!The salad was delicious, with no issues at all.My total came to just over JPY 8000 for some drinks and food. However, considering the expensive area of Omotesando, the cost-performance isnÅft particularly concerning; given the quality of the sushi, it seems reasonable. I was just shocked by how terrible the tempura was. Unless something changes significantly, I don't think I will return. I might reconsider if thereÅfs zero wait time."
Opens at 10:30 AM,"I visited at 10:30 AM on a weekday, and there were numbered tickets displayed outside with a few people already lined up. I thought arriving early would be fine, but there were quite a few people who came at 10:30. Everything I tried was delicious. The dining time was limited to 70 minutes."
First Visit,"On a Monday at 7 PM, I entered the non-conveyor standing dining area (though there are chairs) without much waiting. Having experienced Onodera Noodle and Onodera Unagi, this was my first time at Kaiten Sushi Onodera. Personally, I was very satisfied."
Satisfied with the Service,"The sushi was delicious, but the attentive service from the staff was exceptional. I believe it's a busy place, but I hope they continue to do well. It was a great meal."
Better than Tuna...,"The ingredients for the sides were delicious. Especially the seasonal yellowtail, the fatty part, shrimp, and chawanmushi (savory egg custard) really stood out. However, it can take quite a while due to the day off, so it's better to get a reservation slip before doing your shopping."
Delicious Sushi in Omotesando,"I arrived right at opening time, so I was able to enter without waiting.Every piece of sushi was absolutely delicious... such quality at this price!I particularly loved the scallops and anago, so I ended up having two plates of each.I definitely want to return."
"Sometimes, Kaiten Sushi is a great choice.","I had lunch with my wife. We enjoyed items like mackerel, trout (which we ordered a second serving of), kohada, marinated fish, splendid sea bream, isaki, surf clam, medium fatty tuna, and fatty tuna with seaweed (though the seaweed could have been better). It was a bit disappointing that there was often no nigiri sushi available, but thinking about it, I suppose I can't really complain since it's kaiten sushi. They use high-quality tuna. Our total was JPY 8,000 for two. The highlights were the tuna and the trout (though only on the first piece). I think it's nice to have this kind of sushi once in a while."
Affordable luxury sushi in Ginza!,"The service and atmosphere are absolutely fantastic! The staff's hospitality was outstanding! The sushi was delicious, and the red vinegar rice was just perfect! The only downside was that the food wasnÅft served that quickly, but the flavor and the quality of the service made it well worth the wait. I'm completely satisfied!"
"Decent taste, but value for money could be better","The emphasis on tuna was quite strong, and it was indeed delicious.However, there are many places that offer tastier options at a lower price.Since this is a kaiten sushi restaurant aiming to provide affordable sushi, I had higher expectations for better quality and lower prices.At this rate, I could just as well get sushi at a similar price at a non-kaiten sushi restaurant."
The toppings are truly impressive.,"The tuna is definitely a signature dish here. The red meat is thick and very firm, but it might be polarizing due to its somewhat bloody taste. The marinated version was deliciousit showed that some skill was involved. The medium-fat tuna offers good value for its price. As for the fatty tuna, it's a solid choice if you're a fan.As for the flying fish, snapper, grouper, bonito, and gizzard shad, it seems it might depend on the chef; the sushi made by the person who prepared these was rather underwhelming. Overall, it didn't quite meet my expectations as sushi."
Had high expectations for Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,"I visited the Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera group, known for earning a Michelin star within a year of opening in NY, with high expectations. I heard they donÅft take reservations, so I arrived at 6 PM on a weekday, expecting to wait. To my surprise, I was seated immediately. For the record, by around 7 PM, the restaurant was fully booked.The entrance exudes luxury, but once inside, while the decor looks lavish in photos, it feels pretty ordinary for a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, although it is clean.As is typical for conveyor belt sushi places, thereÅfs a lively shout of ""WeÅfve got a new order!"" when food is delivered, which brings a good atmosphere. However, considering itÅfs a high-end establishment and its location in Harajuku, perceptions may vary.Now, for the taste: While itÅfs certainly different from 100 yen conveyor belt sushi, I was disappointed because I expected to enjoy high-quality sushi from ""Ginza Onodera"" in a more affordable format.I tried the renowned Yamakou tuna, eating both the lean and chu-toro cuts. They were at a level that could be found at a sushi shop offering a 10,000 JPY omakase or 3,800 JPY for 10 pieces. I wondered if perhaps they had a bad shipment that day, as they didnÅft even reach that standard.The three types of uni from different regions included one that had turned gelatinous; I wondered if it would hardly sell even at half price as clearance at a fish market. Other users' photos show variations of uni that have similar gelatinous appearances, so I wonder if this is the quality they serve (they mentioned Bafun uni and Murasaki uni). I recall sushi restaurants in Manila, Philippines, serving uni like that. The other two units were not as melted but lacked the granular quality, and comparing their flavors didnÅft provide much to discuss.Additionally, it was surprising to find some menu items sold out at 6 PM. They had few options from the start and charge somewhat high prices. On this day, one of the missing items was... anago (sea eel)???For a conveyor belt sushi place, having a staple like anago unavailable at such an early hour seems like quite a flaw.Overall, I would honestly compare the experience to paying double for cheap but taste-focused conveyor belt sushi chains like ""Nemuro Hanamaru"" or ""Choshi Maru."" Conversely, if I think of this as getting to eat ""Ginza Onodera"" sushi at a quarter of the price, then perhaps I can consider myself fortunate."
Casual access to high-end sushi in Ginza,"We visited as a group of four. The sushi rice was seasoned with red vinegar and had the perfect amount, while the toppings were large, making it the best size for me. I had made a reservation in advance, so I didn't have to wait long to be seated. However, especially on weekends and holidays, there are limited four-person booths, so I believe it's necessary to have a reservation to avoid a long wait."
Enjoy both Kaiten Sushi and Counter Sushi!,"I sat at the counter. The fatty tuna was outstanding. The marinated mackerel was also delicious, perfectly prepared to my taste. The way they cooked the anago (broiled eel) was great as well. The nori (seaweed) was tasty too. The craftsmanship of the chefs was superb. However, the rice today felt a bit dry. I wondered if the water ratio was off. To put it plainly, it was a bit hard. The rice stuck to my teeth and was difficult to remove. I'm not sure if this is the norm or if it was just a one-time occurrence, so my opinion may change on my next visit. Please don't take this review too seriously. I do want to come back again."
Delicious!,"The food was really delicious, but I'm not a fan of white rice, so I won't be returning."

Sushi at Onodera in Omotesando!,I visited the main branch of Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera.The quality is no longer what you'd expect from regular conveyor belt sushi!I really enjoyed my meal!
Kaiten sushi offers unique advantages that standing sushi bars can't match.,"Conveyor sushi has its own charm, but...Nothing is actually spinning (tears), and the tuna looks discolored.The sushi served now is completely different from the photos when they first opened."
Roughly Made Sushi,"I was thinking of going to the standing sushi bar, but I heard it will reopen in June. So I visited this non-conveyor sushi place instead. I didn't plan to report on it, so I didn't take any photos.On Thursday, May 26th, around 5:30 PM. There were some empty seats, and I was shown to a table right away.I ordered some sushi featuring my companion's favorite types of fish, starting with mackerel and small horse mackerel. Both were excellent and paired well with the sushi rice, so the meal started off well. However, the mackerel sushi was quite poorly shaped. While the mackerel itself was delicious, it didn't hold together as sushi.It seems thereÅfs quite a disparity in the skills of the sushi makers here. The sea bream that followed was also lacking a sense of unity, not quite what I'd call sushi.From our seat, we could see the sushi maker closest to the entrance, who was quite fastmaybe a bit too hastybut their technique was rather nice. It seems that not all the artisans here possess the same level of skill.I ordered marinated tuna out of curiosity for comparison with other restaurants. The tuna was indeed delicious, but IÅfd say the quality as sushi was only around a 3 out of 10. The red clam was pretty good. As for the sea eel, while the fish was tasty, the glaze application was sloppy, and it didnÅft have any level of completion as sushi. The castella egg was expected to have a fluffy texture, but it didnÅft have much flavor.For my closing dish, I had kanpyo maki. This was the most impressive part of the meal today. The strong acidity of the sushi rice combined with the sweetness of the kanpyo and the crisp seaweed created a wonderful harmony. I would have preferred a bit more rice, packed more firmly, but thatÅfs just a matter of personal preference.I don't think I will revisit this place, but I definitely want to try the standing bar. IÅfm curious to see what kind of sushi one artisan can make using the same ingredients."
Innovative Kaiten Sushi Experience?,Everything I tried was truly delicious. The affordable tuna from Yamakou and sushi from Onodera is simply the best.
