0,"The tuna was amazing, but everything else was disappointing.","Located just near Omotesando Station, I visited Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera after hearing a lot of buzz on social media.On a weekday around 1 PM, there were about 8 groups ahead of me, and I waited around 20 minutes to be seated. It seemed like around 80% of the customers were foreign tourists. The atmosphere felt more geared towards inbound visitors rather than sushi enthusiasts.You order from a panel, and the staff places the sushi on the non-moving conveyor belt. The interior has a sophisticated vibe, but the staff lacked energy and a sense of hospitality.I initially ordered yellowtail, salmon, sweet shrimp, and geoduck, but both the salmon and yellowtail were average and didn‚Äôt impress me. The shrimp and shellfish had a strong fishy smell, which was quite disappointing. I‚Äôve never encountered such a fishy taste even at budget conveyor sushi chains.Undeterred, I tried the medium fatty tuna and tuna gunkan (sushi rolls), and the tuna was incredibly delicious. It‚Äôs their specialty, and I was relieved to find it lived up to its reputation. The medium fatty tuna was large and melt-in-your-mouth, providing a satisfying experience.I hesitated to order more, but fearing another disappointing dish, I decided to leave. For better cost performance and taste, I‚Äôd recommend visiting other popular conveyor sushi spots instead of this one, aside from the tuna.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

1,"A renowned spot in Ginza, but the rice and vinegared flavor could use some improvement.","To be upfront, I don't have much experience with high-end sushi, so I'm not sure if my evaluation is fair. However, personally, I feel it doesn't quite live up to the other reviews.If I wanted standing sushi (not that this place is one), I would go elsewhere.It's located down an alley in Omotesando. You can wait in line using E park, but on a Thursday after 6 PM, it wasn't even necessary.That's impressive enough. There were many inbound tourists, but also a few Japanese customers.The ceiling sparkles, giving a luxurious impression. It definitely has a photogenic vibe.I started off with a beer.Now, the menu is on a tablet. There are many tempting options, and while the prices are reasonable, they are still on the higher side.I ordered a few items at random.Overall impressions:- The fish was decent, but nothing stood out, and it didn't fully bring out the quality of the ingredients.- The rice left no impression. If I recall correctly, it was a bit hard. It was red vinegar, but I can't remember any distinct flavorswas it sour or sweet?- For high-end sushi, I expect a harmony between the fish and rice, but this felt more like a mid-range conveyor belt sushi level.Well, if this is the quality for the price, I think I‚Äôm good with that.The freshly prepared sea bream and the swordfish were quite tasty, though.I hope they can attract more inbound demand.Thank you for the meal!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

2,A restaurant catering to foreign travelers,"Kaiten Sushi Onodera near Omotesando Station.I made a reservation online and was told to expect a one-hour wait, but I received a notification that my table was ready just 15 minutes later. Since I was far away, I arrived 15 minutes after the notification, only to find that I had to check in again and ended up waiting an additional 30 minutes.The system was confusing, and perhaps due to the busy atmosphere, the staff at the reception seemed a bit rude.All orders are placed via iPad, with each piece of sushi costing around JPY 500.The sushi was incredibly delicious! The raw sakura shrimp gunkan and toro-taku were especially tasty!While the staff poured Japanese sake with cheerful shouts, which might be fun for foreign travelers, personally, I felt that it wasn't necessary to be here.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

5,Inbound-Friendly Kaiten Sushi in Omotesando,"Dinner during Golden Week.At the casual branch of Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, you can order sushi according to your appetite, making it easy to enjoy a light meal.The restaurant is a dazzling large establishment in Omotesando. You can easily spot it by the crowd of customers waiting around the entrance. About 80% of those waiting were inbound foreign visitors.We made a web reservation and arrived earlier than the estimated time of 4 hours. The system is quite unreliable, as it notifies you of your turn while you‚Äôre still on the train, which makes the estimated time feel low-precision. However, since we had a reservation, we checked in and were called shortly after. In the end, making a reservation is definitely recommended.Orders are placed individually on tablets. According to my daughter‚Äôs research, the recommended item is the Hon Maguro from Yamako, with prices like JPY 730 for Chutoro (medium fatty tuna) and JPY 990 for Otoro (fatty tuna). I wondered if these were tourist prices, but we went ahead and ordered.The highlights included Otoro, Chutoro, Nakaochi Gunkan, Aosa Miso Soup, and Aburi Salmon, with my daughter particularly enjoying the Hokkaido live octopus.The Aburi Salmon had just the right amount of fat and saltiness, which I liked. The Aosa Miso Soup was delicious with a rich shellfish broth. My daughter loved the Hokkaido live octopus so much that we ordered three plates of it. However, the Murasaki Uni (purple sea urchin) was honestly a bit disappointing, as it lacked the expected flavor of uni.The prices are on the higher side! I believe you can find sushi of the same quality for a bit cheaper at places like Tsukiji. But for foreign visitors, the entertainment value might make it worth recommending.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

6,Enjoy famous sushi in a casual setting,"I finally got to visit Onodera, a place I had wanted to try for a long time! It definitely had an atmosphere geared towards inbound tourists, with many visitors from abroad. Perhaps because my expectations were so high, I felt the cost-performance ratio was lacking. The toro and otoro made with Yamako's tuna were incredible, but I found them difficult to chew. The price per piece seemed to range from JPY 400 to JPY 1000. For tourists, I think it‚Äôs a great option!  If you want to eat a lot, I estimate it would cost around JPY 10,000 per person.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

7,The Most Famous Tuna Kaiten Sushi Restaurant: Ginza Onodera,"I've been wanting to visit this sushi restaurant for a long time. It's a kaiten sushi place from the Onodera group, famous for winning the top tuna at auctions every year.I had lunch at their main branch in Ginza before, and it was incredibly delicious, so my expectations were high even for a kaiten sushi restaurant.They open at 10:30 AM, and I arrived at 11:00 AM. After about a 10-minute wait, I was seated! Although it‚Äôs called kaiten sushi, the sushi doesn‚Äôt actually rotate. You order via a touch panel and receive your sushi directly from the staff.I focused on tuna, ordering seared chutoro, chutoro, tekka maki, and akami. Even considering my tuna bias, everything was incredibly tasty! Surprisingly, the akami was quite fatty and I loved it! Of course, the chutoro was even more melt-in-your-mouth delicious.I also enjoyed my favorite engawa and bonito. The bonito was in season and incredibly fresh!I had plans for a caf as my second stop, so I finished with about 60% fullness.At around JPY 4500 for this amount, it felt a bit pricey, but the taste is guaranteed. I recommend it for those who want to enjoy delicious sushi without a high barrier to entry, especially if you love tunait's definitely worth a visit!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

Additionally, the option to choose less rice is a nice touch! It‚Äôs a considerate service for women and those with smaller appetites.Important note for visitors:You can register for a waitlist through EPARK. They stopped accepting registrations around 19:40, so I recommend arriving early if you plan to visit!The restaurant was very lively with many foreign tourists.

I enjoyed a variety of cuts including lean, marinated, chu-toro, o-toro, cheek meat, toro-taku, and tekka maki, and they were all exquisite. The dishes besides tuna are also delightful.

The noise level in the restaurant felt very much geared towards tourists, so it might not be the best place for those looking to enjoy sushi in a calm atmosphere.

The customer turnout is impressive and quite enviable.The sushi toppings are moderately thin and vary in quality, but overall, they are quite tasty.However, there seems to be a lack of awareness regarding the people and things around them. I got a strange impression that it‚Äôs neither a luxurious high-end restaurant nor a systematic, value-oriented chain.While I believe the quality is close to that of a high-end restaurant, it would have been nice to feel a delicate touch that distinguishes it from a chain restaurant in a positive way.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

The location is convenient, just a short walk from the station. The medium fatty tuna and steamed eel were absolutely delicious. I prefer the medium fatty tuna over the fatty tuna. Overall, the portions were generous and tasty. We spent JPY 20,000 for two, which seems reasonable, but compared to other places like Manten Sushi, it felt a bit pricey.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

30,Casual Dining at Yamako,"While high-end restaurants offering omakase courses are undeniably delicious, there are times when you simply want to select what you want to eat freely.I had a strong craving for sardines and decided to revisit this place based on my previous positive experience. I was worried about the crowd due to the inbound tourism, but surprisingly, I arrived around 11:40 on a weekday and had almost no waiting time. What a relief! ‚òÅEhis restaurant, Onodera, is well-known since it's featured during the first auction at Toyosu.I appreciate that they serve real bluefin tuna from Yamako at this conveyor sushi restaurant. The conveyor belt is still at a standstill, as usual. Of course, I ordered the medium fatty tuna, and in addition to the regular sardines, there was a new itemgrilled sardines.I noticed slight acidity from the vinegar-marinated raw sardines, so I preferred the grilled version. It was topped with fried green onions. The winter sardines were rich in fat and delicious.On that day, there were also grilled swordfish and boiled snow crab available. The marinated ikura (salmon roe) was delightful.I was disappointed to learn that the boiled sweet shrimp was sold out (ÅEõÔºÅEDuring my last visit in early summer, I realized that fish taste better in winter and appreciated that I could order as much medium fatty tuna as I wanted today.

I made a reservation and was able to enter without waiting since it was my turn when I arrived.Although it‚Äôs called a kaiten (conveyor belt) sushi restaurant, they no longer use the conveyor belt, so it‚Äôs not really kaiten sushi anymore.The interior is quite spacious, with semi-private booths and table seating available.There were many international customers.The prices are high, but the taste is absolutely delicious. I was waiting for soy sauce to be served in a small dish, but the chef applied it directly on the sushi before serving, which was amusing.The cost-performance ratio isn‚Äôt great, so I feel like it‚Äôs a place I‚Äôd like to visit just once.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

34,"High expectations may have been the issue; the sushi was delicious, but satisfaction was another story? ~ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera (Omotesando)","I visited the Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, a high-end sushi restaurant that usually has a high threshold for entry, located in Omotesando. I went during the weekend lunch hour, and based on comments from other diners on sites like Tabelog, it seems to get crowded at all times. The restaurant opens at 10:30 AM and does not accept reservations, so I arrived just after 10:00 AM, checked in on the tablet at the entrance, and waited for opening time. I thought I would be able to enter on time as the third group, but when I got there, there was a crowd at the entrance. Ultimately, they did not open on time, and I had to wait about 20 minutes outside to get in. It felt like a long wait in the freezing cold, almost like it was going to snow.Inside, the layout consists of a U-shaped counter and a few table seats. Generally, you are guided to the counter. Each seat has a tablet in front of it, and the tea served is powdered, similar to regular kaiten sushi places, so there wasn't a special feeling here. The numbered clips attached to the tablet screens are used for billing. You place your order on the tablet and then take this clip to the register to pay. I quickly selected my toppings on the tablet and ordered my sushi.‚ñ† Yamako Hon Maguro Chutoro (JPY 680)The highlight here is the tuna from Yamako, and I ordered the chutoro first. It was served with soy sauce already applied. The chutoro had a melt-in-your-mouth flavor, and the portion was generous.‚ñ† Aosa Miso Soup (JPY 350)After waiting for 20 minutes in the rain mixed with sleet, I was chilled to the bone and craved something warm, so I ordered the miso soup right away. The aosa seaweed added a nice flavor to the soup, providing a comforting moment.‚ñ† Homemade Fish Head Soup (JPY 540)My wife ordered the fish head soup. I was pleased to find large pieces of fish head in it, and I wished I could have more.‚ñ† Homemade Onodera Chawanmushi (JPY 560)The chawanmushi had a refreshing yuzu flavor, and the broth was delicious, leaving me wanting more.‚ñ† Shimaaji (JPY 500)The beautiful shimaaji was thinly sliced, which I assume is characteristic of this fish.‚ñ† Engawa (JPY 500)The engawa had a crunchy texture yet rich flavor.‚ñ† Live Hokkigai (JPY 800)The highlight of the day for me was this hokkigai, which tasted incredibly fresh, as if it had just been prepared. There was no fishy smell, and the crunchy texture was delightful, even enjoying the siphon.‚ñ† Akah Ebi (JPY 480)The rich flavor of the shrimp was delightful, and my husband was pleased.‚ñ† Seafood Ehomaki (JPY 620)I visited during the Setsubun season, and when I saw the ehomaki on the menu, I ordered it. It was a luxurious roll topped with sea urchin, caviar, and salmon roe. It was a happy roll that included all the toppings I wanted to try.‚ñ† Yamako Hon Maguro Nakao Gunkan (JPY 480)I ordered this to enjoy the nori as well. The nakao was delicious as it melted in my mouth.‚ñ† Yamako Hon Maguro Tekka Hosomaki (JPY 780)I realized that the red meat was also very tasty.‚ñ† Yamako Hon Maguro Chutoro (JPY 680)Finally, I was torn about what to eat next... and I decided on the chutoro again. I requested it to be made without soy sauce. I realized that enjoying it according to my preference was the best way to savor it.After all this, the total came to just over JPY 10,000. Considering it was a high-end sushi restaurant, I thought it was reasonably priced, but at this price point, visiting frequently would be difficult. The clear billing process is a definite advantage. The red vinegar rice had a strong flavor from the salt and vinegar, and the fact that it was served with soy sauce already applied might be a matter of personal preference.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

39,The character for food means to improve people; it signifies their betterment. @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,"""The conveyor has stopped, haha, at Kaiten Sushi Onodera""In recent years, the Onodera Group has gained a reputation by collaborating with Yamatsuki to procure the first tuna of the new year (Ichiban Maguro). This location combines Kaiten (conveyor belt) sushi and standing sushi bar in one place, which is situated in Omotesando. While strolling down Omotesando, I suddenly remembered and decided to visit for the first time since its opening.Despite being just before dinner peak time, there were already more than ten groups of foreigners waiting, haha. Still, I was able to enter relatively smoothly.„ÄêAtmosphere of the restaurant„ÄëAs usual, it gives off a ""luxurious"" rather than ""high-end"" vibe, and it seems to cater to foreign customers, haha. After being seated, I was surprised to find that the familiar conveyor belt was not operating. Upon inquiring, I learned that they had changed from the conveyor belt system to a more traditional plate service style. The concept has shifted, haha...While such a comment may seem unnecessary, it seems like it turned out fine, haha. The reason for this change is that about 70% of the customers are foreigners, and it was also considered from a hygiene standpoint.„ÄêOrder details at Kaiten Sushi Onodera„ÄÅEFlatfish (JPY 350). ‚óÅESquid (JPY 300). ‚óÅEYamatsuki Hon Maguro Assorted (Otoro, Chutoro, Akami) (JPY 2000). ‚óÅEPurple Sea Urchin (JPY 1100). ‚óÅESprout Negi (JPY 210). ‚óÅEAosa Seaweed Soup from Ise-Shima (JPY 350). ‚ñ≥ Kanpyo Hosomaki (JPY 370). ‚ñ≥ Homemade Castella Egg (JPY 320). ‚óã„ÄêFood impressions„ÄëThe ""Tekka Maki"" I ordered was sold out,In the end, my total came to around JPY 5000, and considering the content, I think it was a good price. In terms of the sushi's quality, I believe it rivals the recently popular high-end standing sushi bars that charge between JPY 7000 and JPY 10000, thanks to their strong procurement power. However, since there are many customers, the execution was a bit messy. For example... while the red vinegar rice was on the smaller side, the cuts of fish varied significantly.If they could ensure a more uniform size and thickness, it would improve the overall experience.Additionally, the kanpyo was quite bland, and yet the wasabi‚Äôs sharpness was overwhelmingly strong, so it might be better to change the wasabi.„ÄêService„ÄëThere was a new entertainment element introduced, where staff enthusiastically shout encouragement when serving drinks and dishes, which seems aimed at foreign customers. I couldn't help but worry, wondering what they would think of Japanese sushi!„ÄêMiscellaneous„ÄëKaiten Sushi Onodera in Omotesando is thriving, recognized globally by foreigners. From a management perspective, my imagination suggests...that with an average customer spending of around JPY 6000, and assuming they receive between 250 and 300 customers daily, the monthly revenue would approximate JPY 40 million to JPY 50 million.It was a great meal!„ÄÅERevised) Personal evaluation points from 2025„ÄÅE1) Due to recent trends in Tabelog, I find it increasingly hard to write honestly, so from 2025, I will evaluate dishes separately on a 3-point scale based on preference rather than good or bad. ‚óÅEVery Much to My Liking‚óÅETo My Liking or Close to My Liking‚ñ≥ Corresponding to Price or Not My Liking(2) Regarding overall scoring, starting in 2025, I will revise it as follows:3.0-3.4 is somewhat deviating from my preference.3.5-3.9 indicates a good restaurant with potential for repeat visits.4.0-4.4 indicates great satisfaction and certain repeat visitation.4.5-5.0 indicates a desire to visit at least four times a year.*Evaluation criteria may change in the future.Thank you for reading to the end.

44,270 million... Truly amazing top-grade tuna,"Sushi SeriesTokyo Edition: VisitingKaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Store in OmotesandoI had been curious about this sushi restaurant, but hadn‚Äôt had the opportunity to go until now. However, every year at the start, the first maguro (tuna) becomes a hot topic, and I always wanted to try it. But I hesitated due to the rumored absurd wait times. This year, though, the tuna looked incredibly appealingit made me want to try it even if it meant waiting a little.Rumor had it that the wait could be up to 10 hours, but when I arrived just after noon, I registered at the machine.It indicated a 6-hour wait for about 80 groups, so I thought to come back in the evening. Yet, while checking the wait information on the app, it seemed to be progressing faster than expected, so I didn‚Äôt venture too far and wandered nearby instead. As it turned out, my wait was about 2 hours, so timing was good.Although there is a conveyor belt at Kaiten Sushi, it wasn't in operation. Orders were placed via a touch panel, and I noticed some newcomers struggling to navigate it. It seems many first-time customers were present. I found the ordering process convenient, but I wished the screen was a bit more intuitive for placing orders.Now, let's get to the crucial part: my impressions of the sushi. I ordered the first maguro, Yamako Hon Maguro, 2 pieces for JPY 1,160 (the cost price is reportedly JPY 30,000 for one piece). Also, I had the Yamako Nakaochi Temaki for JPY 2,000.The first item to arrive was the hand roll, overflowing with nakaochi. It's the best hand roll I've ever had. Next came the two pieces of maguro. This set included Akami (lean tuna) and Chutoro (medium fatty tuna), with a limit of one serving per person. The akami was absolutely outstandingI‚Äôve never had anything quite like it; it was incredibly delicious. I felt like I could wait hours for this level of flavor.Next, I tried the chutoro, but the delightful taste of the akami slightly overshadowed its impact. Nonetheless, the chutoro was also wonderfully delicious. My satisfaction level was MAXjust outstanding!My first experience with the first maguro and Yamakothank you, Onodera! I appreciate it.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

The Yamako Hon Maguro Chutoro melted in my mouthpure joy!The cuts were generously sized, with the Kohada nearly hiding the rice! The rice was firm and red, which felt unusual for kaiten sushi.

71,"Exceptional Bluefin Tuna, Botan Shrimp, and Sea Urchin.","I visited this place for a study on high-end sushi. However, true upscale sushi restaurants often come with a high barrier to entry, so I opted for Kaiten Sushi. I wondered if the hon-maguro (bluefin tuna) at Yamako would be as delicious as the rumors claimed.- Hon-Maguro from YamakoThe cuts are thick, allowing me to truly savor the rich flavor of the tuna. While I've previously found that the freshest and most delicious tuna comes right after a fish-cutting demonstration, this one had a melt-in-your-mouth sweetness that was on another level. This is fantastic.- Botan Ebi (Sweet Shrimp)I tried several types of shrimp, including kuruma ebi, botan ebi, akai ebi, and steamed shrimp, but botan ebi was definitely the best.- Uni (Sea Urchin)I had two pieces for comparison. The quality was evident just by looking at themthe shape of the grains was different from what I usually see. Each piece offered a distinct flavor, allowing me to truly enjoy the excellence of uni.Other toppings were also impressive, as expected from high-end sushi. However, I found the rice a bit mysterious. While I was very satisfied with the fluffy texture provided by the chef using red vinegar, the rice grains felt slightly firm. When I sampled just one grain, it had an al dente texture similar to risotto. Hmmm. Is it a rule that high-end sushi should have firmer rice? Or was I just fortunate to encounter a specific cooking style?That's all for my sushi study. Thank you for the delicious meal!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

74,"Michelin One-Star Supervised, Non-Conveyor High-End Sushi","On Friday, I arrived at 10:30 AM and immediately seated despite a couple of groups already being there. I was excited to try the Otoro (fatty tuna) from Ooma in such a casual atmosphere.Orders are placed via tablets at each table, and sushi is delivered to your seat on plates, much like at a conveyor belt sushi place. It was quite a surreal sight to see a conveyor belt without any sushi flowing on it, haha!Since it was my first visit, I decided to indulge a bit and ordered 19 different types of sushi, one piece each, along with two rolls, which really filled me up. I also had sparkling wine and draft beer, finishing with a miso soup, totaling about JPY 14,000.If it were a high-end restaurant, the bill could easily reach around JPY 25,000. While the quality and execution differ, I often go to Uokiji Nihonichi and it gives a similar satisfaction for about JPY 7,000.Overall, it felt a bit pricey. Given that a piece of the Ooma medium fatty tuna costs around JPY 650, it might be better to enjoy the tuna for about JPY 5,000 to JPY 6,000 and leave in a flash.It was a great meal!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

75,First Experience at Onodera,"This year, I couldn't go to the top tuna spots, but finally made my way to Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera for my first meal of the new year!One significant change is that you can now make online reservations and obtain a waiting number, which I wasn't aware of, so I just walked in. Additionally, the standing counter has been replaced with two tables for four guests.Note: The chefs are not in front of you, as the waitstaff will bring your orders.Date: WeekendTime: Around 11:15 AMWaiting Number: Approximately 55Wait Time: I was called around 12:45 PM.You have 60 minutes at the table, but since the dishes come out quickly, I think you‚Äôll find it more than sufficient.The tuna is indeed exquisite! They offer seasonal selections that may not be available next time, so if you see something you want, don‚Äôt hesitate to order!For example, the scallops we had that day were smaller because they're not in season, but they were stacked two together. However, they actually seemed larger than usual.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

76,"Delicious tuna, truly a top-tier kaiten sushi restaurant.","From the Omotesando intersection, head towards Harajuku and turn left at the next alley. At 2 PM on a weekday, there‚Äôs no wait, but it‚Äôs almost full. More than half of the guests are undoubtedly international visitors.Of course, I started with the tuna. The lean cut is rich in flavor, and both the medium-fat and fatty tuna are superbly delicious. For reference, the prices are JPY 420 for the lean, JPY 620 for the medium-fat, and JPY 930 for the fatty tuna, per piece.The rice was a bit hard and crumbled when I tried to eat it with chopsticks, so I decided to wash my hands and eat with my fingers after using hand sanitizer.The sanma (mackerel pike) wasn‚Äôt very fresh, but the boiled shrimp was quite good. The pickled mackerel and salmon belly were just okay.Personally, I thought the lean tuna was the best, so I ordered two pieces along with the toro-taku roll, and it was reliably delicious.However, the miso soup with Aosa seaweed had almost no seaweed in it as seen in the photo, and the broth tasted rather weak, so I had just one sip and left it.For dessert, I had a dessert wine from Katsunuma called Argano. I wished it had a bit more volume.After all this, the bill for two of us exceeded JPY 20,000.

80,Affordable and Delicious Sushi in Omotesando,"A coworker's family came from abroad for summer vacation. Since they have a child who prefers fish over meat, we decided to choose the premium kaiten sushi.As we couldn't make a reservation in advance, we registered through the app at 6:30 PM and found out there were 23 groups ahead of us. When we arrived at 7 PM, we confirmed our registration and got an estimate of the waiting time.We had to wait about 40 minutes, so we took a stroll with my coworker's family down Takeshita Street to pass the time. Since we registered through the app, we received a call and email as our reservation time approached.Once inside, we placed our orders via a tablet. There were many inbound customers, so the system was available in English, Chinese, and Korean.It was unfortunate that the sushi didn't rotate, possibly due to the pandemic's impact. The tuna they are famous for was excellent, and the anago (sea eel) prepared at their main store in Ginza was delicious as well.

I had other plans, so it was a side visit, but I didn't really feel it was worth the effort to come here.There are other conveyor sushi places that offer higher quality in both price and taste, so I don't think this place is necessary.

95,Popular Kaiten Sushi with Many International Guests,"I discovered a ticket system for waiting in line right in front of the cash register.There are two types of sushi: Kaiten (conveyor belt) sushi and standing sushi. When I visited, there were 20 groups waiting for Kaiten sushi and 5 groups for standing sushi.Thinking that waiting less would be better, I took a ticket for the standing sushi, but it seems there were more openings in the Kaiten sushi section, so I was directed there.Upon further inquiry, I learned that the standing sushi only has seven seats, resulting in slow turnover. Plus, despite being called standing sushi, the presence of chairs makes it even slower.I could see how many groups were ahead of me on my smartphone, but I was curious as to why the number fluctuated. It turns out that sometimes a customer returns after being skipped when they weren't available when called.As for the sushi, while it appears they're sourcing fresh ingredients, most of the white fish didn't seem to exhibit the traditional Edomae preparation; the quality at Onodera's other branch, Trymon, was better for the same price range.

You‚Äôll find the fatty tuna, medium fatty tuna, and lean cuts available, as well as grilled options and gunkan.The striped jack was freshly filleted and incredibly delicious due to its freshness.The sweet shrimp was also creamy, and the shrimp heads were deep-fried, making them edible.I finished off the meal with some hosomaki (thin rolls).","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

100,Non-Rotating Sushi at Onodera,"Every time I come to Omotesando, I‚Äôve been curious about this place. After dinner or not being able to align my timing, I finally got lucky to find it mostly empty on a weekday evening, so I decided to enter.Even at an early hour, it was nearly full, with a lot of foreign patrons and a lively atmosphere.You place your orders entirely through the tablet at your seat, and I noticed they had tuna from Yamako, so I of course ordered that along with several other dishes.Each piece of tuna from Yamako is served individually, which might make it feel slightly overpriced overall; however, I believed the quality would be worth it, so I ordered medium-fatty, lean, and marinated to compare the flavors.Eating quickly, I spent about JPY 3000. Hmm, it really feels quite upscale for a conveyor sushi restaurant! But given that it's not actually conveyor sushi at all, this might be fair pricing after all!I‚Äôd be really happy if foreign visitors could easily enjoy authentic Japanese sushi and come to appreciate it through this experience!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

102,A bit lacking in flavor...,"I visited the ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" located in Omotesando, but I was somewhat disappointed with the taste of the sushi.Although it positions itself as a high-end kaiten sushi restaurant, I didn't feel any sense of special quality in terms of the freshness of the ingredients and the quality of the rice.The fish didn't seem as fresh as I expected, and the flavor wasn't as satisfying. The tuna was a bit tough.Additionally, the staff's service felt somewhat cold, and perhaps because they seemed busy, there were moments where their efficiency felt lacking. Given that it‚Äôs a kaiten sushi style restaurant, some of this is understandable, but a little more attentive service would have significantly increased my satisfaction.Since it's located in Omotesando, it may be suitable for tourists or those who want to experience it at least once. However, avid sushi lovers might find it somewhat lacking.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

After researching, I found out that Tachigui Sushi Akira also uses Yamazaki tuna. I wonder if they process it differently.

They also grabbed media attention by jointly auctioning tuna with Yamazaki at the New Year‚Äôs first auction. Their business has expanded to include tempura and charcoal-grilled dishes, transitioning them into a major restaurant group that draws attention both at home and abroad.Their new business model is conveyor belt sushi.In 2021, they opened ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" in Omotesando. While maintaining the casual and reasonable essence of conveyor belt sushi culture, they present top-quality ingredients that are surprising for a conveyor sushi restaurant. The casualization of sushi, which has become one of the high-end dishes, seems to be a trend, and the Onodera group has brilliantly succeeded in making it more casual, attracting many customers, particularly from abroad, to a fully booked restaurant on a daily basis.The highlight is undoubtedly the tuna from Yamazaki.Offering fatty tuna for over JPY 1000 is exceptional. The vinegared rice matches perfectly with the quality, clearly exceeding the typical conveyor belt sushi experience. The toro-taku roll using Yamazaki's tuna is a must-try.There are also unique menu items not typically found in Edo-mae sushi. I'm sure international guests and children will love them, too.

The system was not functioning well, and I ended up waiting nearly two hours. They have a system where they call you when your number is near, but if you are not present when called, you could miss your turn and end up waiting much longer.

The chu-toro also seemed to lack sufficient fat.The bluefin tuna I had in Hokkaido was tastier.I also tried the recommended three pieces of sea bream, striped jack, and yellowtail, but they didn't impress me much.The marinated mackerel and kohada sushi were well-seasoned with vinegar, which I enjoyed.Many customers around me were ordering salmon, so I decided to try it too; it was slightly fatty but tasted average.The fin meat had good thickness and resilience but was somewhat lacking in fat.Inexpensive conveyor belt sushi often has surprisingly rich salmon and fin meat, so this might be seen as underwhelming.If you're looking for fat, the salmon belly might be a better choice.The miso soup was voluminous and worth the price, containing fish bones and a piece that resembled salmon fillet, providing a satisfying bite.I wish the flavor of the miso soup had been a bit stronger.Overall, it was better than average conveyor belt sushi, but I still felt the price didn't align with the quality.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

123,Charming Kaiten Sushi in Omotesando,"This sushi restaurant in Omotesando always has a waiting list of dozens of groups. On this occasion, we were lucky enough to secure a counter seat for two just after 11 AM. The interior is beautifully decorated and has a luxurious feel, although the conveyor belt is there, it isn't actually in operation. All orders are placed through a touch panel. The menu offers a variety of options ranging from over JPY 1000 for a single piece to around JPY 300 for two pieces. However, being here, we couldn't resist choosing some of the more expensive and delicious-looking options. The medium fatty tuna simply melts in your mouth, and every piece we tried was fresh, even the nori on the sushi was delightful. Both the drinks and sushi complemented each other perfectly, making for a highly satisfying lunch. Even though my companion doesn't drink alcohol, our total came to just over JPY 10,000 for two. It‚Äôs a bit pricey, but as we settled the bill, I noticed that there were already more than ten groups waiting, which speaks volumes about the restaurant's popularity.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

124,Entertainment was also included,"I got a numbered ticket online and strolled around Omotesando, waiting about 30 minutes for my turn to enter.The ordering method was similar to the recent trend of ordering via tablet at sushi restaurants, but seeing the chefs preparing and rolling the sushi right in front of me truly felt like the essence of a sushi shop.Everything I tried was incredibly delicious, but the Engawa (flounder belly) especially stood out.During my visit, there was a fun quiz to guess the weight of a large grouper, and I won a free grouper nigiri for getting close to the answer.The restaurant was lively, always filled with customers, which clearly explained its popularity. I definitely want to visit again.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

125,Casual even for solo diners.,"Dinner for one in Omotesando.This place came to mind.It seemed to attract many overseas tourists.I was told there would be a 60-70 minute wait, but since I was dining alone, I was called in just 10 minutes.This was a pleasant surprise.You can feel the passion behind every menu item, especially their strong emphasis on shrimp.I indulged a bit, so it was on the pricier side, but for delicious sushi that's not excessively expensive, this is a great spot.I discovered a fantastic restaurant for solo dinners.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

129,To be honest...,"‚óÅEn TasteThis restaurant promotes itself with the name 'Onodera', but I believe there are only a few sushi toppings that are actually served here. If you enter expecting the authentic Onodera experience based solely on the name, you might feel a bit let down (laughs). While the sushi is tasty, there's nothing that truly amazes you. Aside from those items labeled 'Onodera's...', I suspect that many of the ingredients might be sourced separately for the Omotesando location rather than being related to Ginza Onodera.Some pieces are hard to bite through, and the taste resembles that of a 100 yen sushi? level in many cases.‚óÅEn ServiceThe service speed is quite fast, comparable to standard conveyor belt sushi. When I visited around 6 PM, I had to wait about 40 minutes. The online reservation system is quite convenient!","Here are the words representing the reviewers' impressions:

* ""let down""
* ""nothing that truly amazes you""

Each table is equipped with a touchscreen for placing orders. We arrived just before the lunch rush and witnessed about 10 groups waiting.

I tried the medium fatty tuna, marinated red meat, tuna and sea urchin gunkan, and the tuna and green onion roll, and the quality of Yamako's tuna was truly delicious. ^^At Onodera, you typically get a set course, but this place is great if you just want to enjoy some tuna quickly!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

139,The pinnacle of conveyor belt sushi. Tonight's soul restoration at Aoyama's Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera.,"After a tough day at work, I needed some comfort from the city lights, so I visited the Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, known for its top-quality tuna from the first auction at Toyosu Market this year. This restaurant is perhaps one of the best revolving sushi spots out there. I thought about my budget but realized that hesitation would lead to regret, so I'm treating myself to a solo dinner tonight.Looking around the counter, I was the only solo diner; everyone else was quite stylish. That‚Äôs the vibe in Aoyama. However, the chefs behind the counter carried on with their work, paying no mind to the romantic interactions of the customers, showcasing their professionalism.All the tuna dishes are served on gold plates, which reflects how much the restaurant values its tuna.‚óÅEEngawa (Flounder Fin) - 2 pieces 440My favorite! They are rich and flavorful. Delicious.‚óÅEAburi (Seared) - 3 pieces 980Engawa, scallop, and what was the middle one? I should have thought about it before eating. The engawa slightly overshadowed the taste, but that‚Äôs okay since it‚Äôs one of my favorites.‚óÅEHirame (Flounder) - 2 pieces 620I like to start with the white fish.‚óÅEYamazaki Hon Maguro (Bluefin Tuna Lean) - 1 piece 420It was like rare beef tenderloin. So much more delicious.‚óÅEKanburi (Winter Yellowtail) - 2 pieces 700It‚Äôs the season for this fish, so I had to try it. Would regret it if I didn't.‚óÅEHand-Made Ikura (Salmon Roe) in Soy Sauce - 700A gem-like ikura in one bite. The allergen information is very considerate.‚óÅEAburi Toro - 1 piece 830As I age, I find some toro too fatty, but searing it makes it perfect. I switched from beer to sake here.‚óÅEHomemade Kohada (Gizzard Shad) - 1 piece 340Is this Edo-mae style? Let's have a piece of a shiny fish. Feeling good about this.‚óÅEYamazaki Hon Maguro Nakaochi (Bluefin Tuna Fatty Scrap) - 2 pieces 720Even if it's nakaochi, it's high-quality fatty tuna, much better than ordinary tuna.‚óÅELive Botan Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) with Fried Head - 950The fried head is a delightful touch! Perfect with sake. The freshly peeled meat is of course deliciousextremely fresh.‚óÅEYamazaki Hon Maguro Chutoro (Bluefin Tuna Medium Fat) - 1 piece 620The big finale with the chutoro. No complaints here.Wow, I completely overindulged without considering my budget. I guess I'll be living off calorie mates starting tomorrow. But tonight, it was all worth it. My heart was mended. Thank you, Onodera, for the heartfelt restoration. It was a wonderful meal. It was great!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

140,Better than usual Kaiten Sushi,"The system requires you to go before the opening and get a numbered ticket. When I found the ticket, it indicated a wait time of 40-50 minutes, but that wasn't the case; I was seated right away (I was around the 13th in line).You can order your favorites through a touchscreen, and they serve you the sushi directly without needing to take anything from the rotating conveyor belt. (I wondered if they were considering past incidents that happened in conveyor belt sushi restaurants.)I also visited the standing sushi spot, Onodera, but I felt more satisfaction there personally. The cost for three of us was just under JPY 15,000. I think it's a place that's easy for international guests to enjoy.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

I have visited their main store in Ginza and the Futako Tamagawa branch, and I have wonderful memories of those visits. So when I learned that they have a Kaiten Sushi version in Omotesando, I had to go! Although I couldn't make a reservation ahead of time, I found out that I could register for a waiting list through EPARK. While at home, I registered for a spot and quickly headed to the restaurant. When I arrived just before opening, there were 15 groups waiting. After successfully being seated just after 11:30! The interior exudes luxury and vibrancy. Even though it's a kaiten sushi, the sushi isn't rotating, and you place your order using a touch panel. Honestly, the quality is unbelievable for a kaiten sushi. The red vinegar rice has a nice gentle warmth, melting perfectly and matching the toppings exquisitely. And the portion sizes of each topping are large and incredibly fresh! I particularly loved the Yamakou Hon Maguro Chutoro and the simmered Anago. It's no surprisetheir top-quality tuna was auctioned off at the first sale of the season. The moment it enters my mouth, it melts perfectly, delivering an incredible taste. The crab miso gunkan is also generously rich. The seasonal Kanburi is a must-try. I appreciate being able to choose the amount of rice as well. During peak times, there‚Äôs a one-hour seating limit, but I was satisfied with the deliciousness in such a short time! It's truly incredible to enjoy authentic and exquisite sushi from Onodera at this price. By around 12:30 when I left, there were 60 groups waitingno wonder it's so popular! The location is also excellent, just a short walk from Omotesando Station. I‚Äôd love to visit again using the EPARK waiting system. By the way, I heard a branch has also opened in Kyoto. When I crave Onodera sushi back in Kansai, I‚Äôll head over to Kyoto. It was a great meal!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

142,Disappointing,"The reasons are as follows:1. Long wait times. Although EPRAK is introduced, which allows for waiting away from the counter, you still feel the pressure to return.2. Prices. They are relatively high, priced at the level where you could dine at a much higher-end sushi restaurant for the same amount.3. The taste is not that impressive. Overall, the seasoning is too strong, and the quality of the ingredients is somewhat lower than expected, given the prices.If you were to remove 'Kaiten Sushi' from the name and eliminate the conveyor belt, and either lower the prices or improve the chefs' training, while putting the long wait times on hold, it might lead to better ratings.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

A luxurious experience dining at the counter, not at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant!","Today, I finally visited a restaurant that had been on my mind for a while!Since I can't go to the main Onodera location, I went to the Omotesando branch.It's incredibly busy here as well.I took a number for both the conveyor sushi and the sashimi, hoping to be seated with the quicker option, but either way, it's a one-hour wait.There are hardly any Japanese customers around it's just like when I visited Noda-Iwa before!There are many people who give up and leave because of the crowd, but after about 45 minutes, I was finally able to get in.Even though I chose the sashimi option, it's a counter sushi experience, with the only difference being that orders are made through a tablet.The distinction between conveyor sushi and counter sushi is that the counter serves the same rice and fish as the main branch.They also take the time to prepare the fish with aging and decorative cuts.In contrast, conveyor sushi has different rice and preparation methods.Of course, the prices are about 10% to 20% higher than conveyor sushi, but personally, I really want to enjoy something delicious like this.No alcohol today.I ordered everything as individual pieces.The most expensive item is the sea urchin at JPY 1300, while most others range from JPY 700 to JPY 800.‚òÅETwo pieces of Kawa Hagi liver‚òÅEScallop‚òÅESalmon roe‚òÅEMedium fatty tuna‚òÅEAbalone‚òÅEWhite shrimp with kombu‚òÅESpring sea bream‚òÅECod roe nigiri‚òÅETwo pieces of bafun uni‚òÅECod milt tempura‚òÅESteamed egg custard with snow crab and salmon roeThe fish was thick, and the rice was red vinegared, which was also delicious. On this day, the chef was youthful and fun, creating a great atmosphere as all the counter seats were occupied by Japanese customers who were happily chatting with each other.This is definitely a place I want to come back to, even if it means waiting in line.Of course, I want to sit at the counter!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

151,Affordable Sushi in the City Center,"At first glance, it looks like an ordinary kaiten sushi place surrounded by the kitchen. But the taste is delightful! I visited around 2:00 PM on a weekday and only had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated. After enjoying as much chutoro, akami, uni, and other favorites as I wanted, my bill came to around JPY 5,000.

152,Affordable High-End Edomae Sushi,"I visited this high-end kaiten sushi restaurant in Ginza, which has even received a Michelin star.Since I went during the peak of lunchtime on a weekday, there were only about three groups waiting. I was seated in about five minutes.The concept of the restaurant is to provide a place where you can enjoy Ginza's exquisite flavors anytime without the high barriers typically associated with it. They offer a lineup comparable to traditional Ginza establishments, featuring red vinegar sushi rice and using top-quality tuna from Yamakou, all at reasonable prices.At certain times, there are announcements in the restaurant, allowing diners to enjoy freshly prepared sushi right on the spot; I got to try some flounder today. It seems they also have a tuna-cutting demonstration occasionally.The sweet shrimp are served with crispy fried heads, making it possible to enjoy the flavor all the way to the roe.The fish soup is generously filled with large cuts of fish, providing a rich, flavorful broth that's quite delicious.I expect weekends to be quite busy. Since they utilize EPARK for managing wait times, I recommend checking EPARK in advance and making an online reservation if possible.It was a great meal.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

The tuna is delicious, of course, but everything is superb. I could eat it forever, especially the way Otoro melts in your mouth! The Hokkaido-produced Botan shrimp was freshly prepared right in front of me, and it's incredibly sweetit's on another level! And the crab miso? It‚Äôs the real deal; you can taste the authentic flavor. Combining it with crab meat made it exceptionally delicious. However, the highlight was the abalone. Again, freshly prepared.

There are counter seats as well as box seats.On a weekday around 12:30 PM, I was able to enter without any wait.I had my sights set on the renowned Yamazaki honmaguro (bluefin tuna), and both the fatty tuna and marinated red meat were astonishingly delicious. The fatty tuna was excellent, but the marinated red meat was the best I‚Äôve ever tasted. The salt-seared engawa (flounder fin) and live octopus were also exceptional.The shoyu ramen had a strong soy sauce flavor, which at times overshadowed the sushi when eaten together.

159,Enjoying the Fun of Choosing Sushi Before the Jingu Gaien Illumination,"After buying some of my favorite bread, I had dinner before heading to Jingu Gaien.This was my first choice, and I had planned to look for somewhere else if there was a long line, but when I arrived, I was able to enter without delay. (No line)It‚Äôs been a while since I visited a Kaiten sushi restaurant, but I love sushi and go nearly once a month.This restaurant only offers an omakase course, so I had always wished for a place where I could order what I wanted.

And now, ordering sushi is mostly done at kaiten sushi which is the most accessible option for me.Knowing about the opening of this restaurant, I wished to visit, and my dream has finally come true.I sat at a large counter (there seemed to be table seating as well) and used a touch panel to order.My husband and I each ordered our favorites, and we tried one of each two-piece item:- Kawa-hagi liver- Yamazaki Toro- Shira-iko ponzu- Ara soup- Aosa soup- Horse mackerel- Overflowing ikura- Abalone- Shime-saba- Snow crab- Botan shrimp- Mizu-ika (squid)- Boiled amaebi- Ankimo gunkan- Toro-taku- Bafun uni- ScallopWhile the quality of the toppings was decent, the sushi rice wasn‚Äôt particularly tasty and lacked texture.It wasn‚Äôt extraordinarily delicious sushi, but I was satisfied with the joy of ordering what I like.From there, I headed straight to the illumination at Jingu Gaien.

I wanted more! We also ordered fried octopus and chawanmushi.The fried octopus had a strong flavor, but it was chewy and delicious.The chawanmushi was luxurious, containing crab, ginkgo nuts, shiitake mushrooms, and salmon roe.

173,Sushi that even Tetsuko enjoyed,"We thought we should try the sushi that Ms. Tetsuko had on her show, so we made a reservation. The online booking system was smooth and convenient. I was so hungry that I ended up eating a lot and forgot to take photos. The medium-fat tuna, anago (grilled eel), and natto rolls were delicious. The natto rolls, in particular, took the top spot in my personal ranking! The high-quality seaweed wrapped lightly around the filling combined with the seasonings was irresistible. Just JPY 230what a great deal! It might be better to share a plate for two, but since the price is higher for just one piece, the cost performance isn‚Äôt the best. Next time, I‚Äôll try either a budget-friendly conveyor belt sushi or a non-conveyor sushi restaurant.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

174,A Sushi Restaurant Not Worth the Trip,"I went here just to accompany a friend, but everything was overpriced and not particularly tasty.

175,"Highest price for Kaiten Sushi, but very satisfying","Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera offers a unique take on conveyor belt sushi. Although the sourcing is the same, the menu likely differs, featuring some interesting items. For instance, it's unlikely you would find fresh herring or small corvina at the Ginza location.They use tuna from Toyosu's Yamako, and the Onodera group has recently been the top bidder for the first tuna auction on New Year's Day.On this day, they had a tuna dismantling show, and it was amazing to hear that over 200 kg of tuna from Oma arrived in September. I tried the fatty tuna for JPY 980, and it was truly exceptionaldefinitely not the level of tuna you'd expect at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant.I ordered the clear soup, and it was generously filled with salmon trimmings! At just JPY 520, it felt like a great deal.While the standard serving is two pieces, there are also options for single pieces, so keep an eye out for that.The rice was red rice, but it didn't feel significantly different from what I had at a standing sushi bar previously, leading me to think they might not be focused on temperature. However, the generous portions were great, and my overseas friends were delighted, so I definitely plan to return.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

176,Premium Ingredient Kaiten Sushi,"This kaiten sushi restaurant uses high-quality ingredients. Unlike typical conveyor belt sushi places, here you order each plate individually via a touch panel. While some reviews mention poor cost-performance, enjoying high-end ingredients like red vinegar sushi at this price is usually impossible. The restaurant operates on a larger scale with fewer chefs than usual, allowing them to offer excellent ingredients at a reasonable cost. The tuna comes from the renowned Yamako, and on the day of my visit, there was a demo of tuna filleting by Yamako. The showcase featured a giant over 300 kg Hon-maguro (bluefin tuna) from Oma. I initially thought it was more about the show, but taking the opportunity, I savored my sushi while watching. Seeing the impressive size of the giant hon-maguro is definitely worth it. I also had the fatty tuna, which was quite good, though it tastes better when properly chilled. In terms of flavor, the Hon-maguro was exceptional. You won't find this quality at other kaiten sushi places.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

178,Affordable Kaiten Sushi Worth the Wait,"Last time it was still quite warm, so I was eager to visit during the colder season. I went around 2 PM on a holiday and had to wait for about an hour. It's nice that there are many shops around, so you can shop while waiting. Once again, I was very satisfied with how much I ate.I believe this place is perfect for when you want to enjoy better sushi than what chain conveyor-belt sushi offers, but you find counter sushi to be too formal and expensive.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

179,Incredibly Delicious Kaiten Sushi at Onodera!,"On my way back from Tochigi, I had a bit of time in Tokyo and decided to have lunch at Onodera. The last time I visited, it was extremely busy, and I had to take a ticket from the machine to secure a table, waiting quite a while before being seated.This time, I was prepared for a long wait, but surprisingly, due to it being a weekday at 1:30 PM, I was able to get in quite easily. It seems like many of the customers were tourists. The atmosphere inside was incredibly lively, and it felt like a bustling sushi restaurant. They also have a great selection of wine, so I decided to enjoy it alongside the delicious sushi.The price per plate ranges from JPY 600 to the low JPY 1000s. Every sushi piece was so delicious that I could easily keep eating. Among the dishes I had this time, I found the akagai (red clam) to be quite a bargain. As for the side dish, the fish bones and leftover parts soup was rich in flavor and very tasty.While enjoying my lunch at Onodera, a sudden torrential rain and thunderstorm caught me off guard. At that moment, I didn't foresee the big trouble that was about to come, and I was just taking it easy, but that‚Äôs when a series of unfortunate events began.All in all, the sushi here is incredibly delicious, making it one of my favorite sushi spots!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

180,No Soy Sauce Needed: A Casual Spot for Authentic Sushi,"I visited during a weekday lunch. When I arrived after 11:00, about 70% of the seats were filled. I noticed around 30% of the guests were foreigners. One person, who seemed to be from NY and looked like a Chinese expatriate, was expressing his amazement, repeatedly telling the sushi chef how great it was. The chef could only respond with 'thank you,' and I thought it would have been nice if he had engaged a bit more; it felt a bit lacking in interaction, haha.We only had sushi, and as far as I can recall, we ordered a variety: lean tuna, fatty tuna, sea urchin, eel, kohada, marinated mackerel, shima aji, salmon roe, tekka maki, and octopus.The sushi rice was made with red vinegar, and most of the toppings were lightly brushed with soy sauce. The sushi rice was so delicious!Also, since I usually go to places like Sushiro, this may be typical, but the wasabi was just a small amount and very spicy, and the gari (pickled ginger) was delightful!I was particularly impressed by the white fish and shima aji. The marinated mackerel and shima aji were exceptional. I felt the same level of excitement as the time I had sushi that cost around JPY 20,000. It was truly delicious. I highly recommend it! I even ordered those two items twice.However, at the entrance of the restaurant, there was a strong odor, possibly from a drainage system, which was quite unpleasant and smelled like sewage. It‚Äôs a bit disappointing to be hit with such a smell right before entering a lovely restaurant in Omotesando. I want to enter and leave feeling good, but I found the experience a bit disappointing both when entering and exiting.But most importantly, the taste of the sushi was absolutely perfect!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

181,Inspired by the Yosakoi Festival,"I had been keeping an eye on Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera for a while, and I finally made my first visit in between the Yosakoi Festival events happening in Harajuku and Omotesando.The restaurant collaborates with renowned wholesalers, including Yamako, to ensure a lineup of always top-quality ingredients. Everything is prepared in-house with intricate knife techniques, providing beautifully crafted Edomae sushi infused with the chef's heartfelt touch.Despite the formal presentation, you can enjoy authentic Edomae sushi at a great price.The ordering and payment system is quite streamlined, making the overall dining experience smooth, although there may be some wait times.Not being a fan of sipping sake with snacks, I began my meal with the top-grade tuna belly from Yamako, which was exceptional alongside the red vinegar rice.Other offerings included homemade simmered conger eel, perfectly grilled sardines, seared salmon, seasonal grilled knife fish, and a crab towerall of which were delightful.

183,Casual Non-Rotating Sushi,"Although it's labeled as kaiten sushi, the ordering is done via a touch panel, so nothing actually rotates on the conveyor.I visited to introduce a place that feels casual yet respectable for my overseas friends who have only been to major chain kaiten sushi.The touch panel supports multiple languages, making ordering and payment clear and easy.The gari (pickled ginger) and wasabi are also part of the touch panel options, but I think one serving of wasabi is enough for two people unless you really love wasabi.The performance of the fish preparation is also quite enjoyable.Water and tea are self-service.The restroom is extremely small, haha.Although the counter seats were close together, the tempura and other dishes were tasty, making it a good choice for casual sushi.It's a bit pricier compared to Hanamitsu, I think?It wasn‚Äôt as crowded as when it first opened, which was nice.You can also reserve a spot through EPARK, which is a plus.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

However, it didn‚Äôt have the same sweetness or melt-in-your-mouth texture as before‚Ä¶ I enjoyed the reliable fish with shine and white flesh!Also, I ordered the Tai-to and received some good-natured cheers from the staff.Next time, I want to choose my sushi according to the seasonal offerings!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

188,"Distinctive features like using red vinegar in the rice set it apart from traditional conveyor belt sushi, but the taste feels just average for the price.","<Ordered items>Yama Ko Hon Maguro Chutoro JPY 620Yama Ko Hon Maguro Tekka Hosomaki JPY 510<Review>I happened to visit this place while strolling around Omotesando in the morning when there was no line.Originally, it was a food service outsourcing company called LEOC, but it formed the ONODERA GROUP in 2018.I had visited their Ginza location before, but this was my first time dining at a kaiten sushi establishment.The store itself is pretty much just an average kaiten sushi restaurant.I expected it to be a bit more upscale, but the interior decor was standard for the type.Ordering is done via a touchscreen, and water is self-serve, which is completely normal for kaiten sushi.What sets this place apart is the high quality of the ingredients and the sushi craftsmanship.They used tuna from 'Yama Ko', and I recall that the famous tuna shop 'Irifune', which used to be in Okusawa, Setagaya, also sourced its fish from Yama Ko.They use red vinegar for the rice, and the toppings come pre-seasoned with soy sauce, indicating a quality closer to that of upscale establishments.While I'm not an expert in sushi, my impression was that it felt a bit 'bland' in comparison to truly high-end sushi places, so there was a noticeable difference.That said, the price range is higher than regular kaiten sushi, similar to Kanazawa Maimon Sushi.Overall, I might consider visiting again if there is no line.<Concerns>From my personal perspective, the satisfaction level of high-end kaiten sushi seems a bit lacking for the price, and honestly, it might be better to visit a more upscale restaurant that offers lunch service.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

It was a truly happy experience.  The yellowtail had large slices and great flavorabsolutely top-notch! The seared salmon was so good that I wanted to order it again.  The uni tasting was also amazing!The prices were JPY 2,500 for uni, JPY 900 for snow crab, and other items were around JPY 500 to 600. I wish they were about JPY 100-200 cheaper. It feels more like a price target towards foreign tourists taking advantage of the weak yen rather than a luxurious dining experience (laughs).I noticed that the red vinegar rice was somewhat weak in holding its shape, as it crumbled and couldn't be picked up twice. Is this just how it is? Personally, I prefer rice that holds its shape a bit better when molded. I'm not sure if this is the standard here, so I'll need to come back to check.The seafood is fresh, thick, and delicious,and since I can enjoy slightly upscale sushi in a casual setting, I plan to visit again.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

196,Unclear values...,"I visited around 4 PM on a weekday for a sushi snack. I originally aimed for the standing sushi bar, but perhaps due to the day of the week or the rotation, the seating area had more open spots. The standing bar seemed to be closed. At that time, the vacancies were noticeable, and I was seated right away. While the touch panel ordering is convenient, I found the menu hard to read. Is it just me? From the limited time recommendations, I ordered the shirasu (young sardine) gunkan for JPY 510, the grilled knife fish for JPY 620, and the grilled kawakawa. The prices are quite high. The sushi was normally tasty, but I didn't find it outstanding for the price. So, I decided to try the special shrimp miso half ramen for JPY 470. It says 'half ramen', but there were only about three bites of noodles. Is that really half? More like mini? No, maybe micro?! Haha! I consider myself accustomed to sushi, but I really don‚Äôt understand the value of this place. For me, my regular spot in Nemuro offers a much higher satisfaction level.

Since there was no line at the Tachigui side, I entered, but be careful as the menu is different from the kaiten sushi! The Tachigui is quite pricey, with each piece costing around JPY 700. I had 5 pieces for a total of JPY 3600. The taste is fantastic! However, the entry system might cause some confusion...","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

205,"A rare kaiten sushi experience in Omotesando, offering easy access to famous sushi from Ginza.","Located right next to Hugo Boss in Omotesando, this sushi restaurant may differ from high-end spots in Ginza, but it offers a casual yet high-quality kaiten sushi experience under the same brand.As you enter, if you head to the right, you'll find a counter where skilled artisans prepare sushi right before your eyes, rather than a typical rotating sushi area.Here, you can place your orders via a tablet, and the freshly made nigiri sushi is served right in front of you. Everything is fresh and delicious. The seasonal nigiri, in particular, offers amazing flavors at reasonable prices. What stood out to me were the sea urchin, flounder, and the exceptional squid.In addition to the rotating sushi menu, there are a few sushi items available for ordering, and I also tried the natto roll, which was absolutely delightful.To finish off, I had a bowl of authentic miso ramen, and although I was completely satisfied, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the entire meal was offered at under JPY 10,000, making it a fantastic value for the quality.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

What a relief! ‚òÅEhis restaurant, Onodera, is well-known since it's featured during the first auction at Toyosu.I appreciate that they serve real bluefin tuna from Yamako at this conveyor sushi restaurant. The conveyor belt is still at a standstill, as usual. Of course, I ordered the medium fatty tuna, and in addition to the regular sardines, there was a new itemgrilled sardines.I noticed slight acidity from the vinegar-marinated raw sardines, so I preferred the grilled version. It was topped with fried green onions. The winter sardines were rich in fat and delicious.On that day, there were also grilled swordfish and boiled snow crab available. The marinated ikura (salmon roe) was delightful.I was disappointed to learn that the boiled sweet shrimp was sold out (ÅEõÔºÅEDuring my last visit in early summer, I realized that fish taste better in winter and appreciated that I could order as much medium fatty tuna as I wanted today.

212,"Sharing the essence of Japan's authentic culture with the world. Impressed by the skill of the red rice and the Takabe. At Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera (Shibuya, Tokyo), enjoy a comparison of premium tuna and Kue, exquisite sea urchin tasting, homemade simmered anago, kohada, Takabe, and Yagara.","While the food and taste received a ‚òÅE.0 rating, the low impression of service and cost performance led to an overall rating of ‚òÅE.4. Although I felt that it deserved a score above my personal best of ‚òÅE.5, there were some downsides.I came to Tokyo to attend a hot spring workshop held in Aoyama. But first, I decided to grab a bite to eat. Since I was treating myself to a sushi experience, I opted for a visit to ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" instead of the usual Ginza sushi.This year marks the third consecutive year that ONODERA GROUP acquired the top tuna at the New Year‚Äôs auction at Toyosu Market. They operate 13 locations across five regions worldwide, three of which have been awarded Michelin stars. With the concept of allowing more people to enjoy traditional Edomae sushi, they opened the main branch of Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in October 2021. A second branch is planned to open in Shijo Kawaramachi, Kyoto, between June and July 2023.I had been checking the reservation site for two weeks prior, hoping to visit at the earliest hour in the morning. Even on a Sunday, it seemed that there wouldn‚Äôt be much of a crowd right after opening, which gave me peace of mind to explore the nearby supermarkets before heading over.I confirmed that there was no wait time through the reservation site. The main branch of Ginza Onodera features an omakase course that costs tens of thousands of yen, which is a bit out of reach for regular folks like me. I‚Äôve only ever dined at Ginza sushi on company expenses and never paid for it myself. This branch, however, offers a chance to enjoy ""Onodera"" at a reasonable price, which I was looking forward to.Ordering was straightforward with a touch panel, clearly displaying the prices, and it was great that I could order individual pieces, making it convenient for someone like me who prefers smaller portions but enjoys various types of fish. This setup ensures that even first-time visitors like me, who might not be familiar with red rice and the intricacies of Edomae sushi, could enjoy their experience with confidence.As I entered the restaurant, I was slightly taken aback by the loud greetings reminiscent of regular conveyor sushi. I took a deep breath as I made my choices. I started with tuna.‚òÅEYamazaki Hon Maguro Chutoro  1 Piece 620 JPY‚òÅEYamazaki Hon Maguro Akami  1 Piece 420 JPYIt was nice to see not only the origin marked as ""Choshi"" but also the specific fishing port indicated.After a while, I relished the long-awaited Yamazaki tuna. The decorative knife work was beautiful. The chutoro was delicious as expected, while the akami left something to be desired. However, I could still appreciate the difference compared to regular hon maguro. I am more inclined towards Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) over Atlantic bluefin (T. thynnus) and have rediscovered that the choice of seasonal regions and careful selection of fish are crucial when evaluating hon maguro.‚òÅEYamazaki Hon Maguro Nakao Gunkan  620 JPYWhile it did not fully meet my expectations, it was certainly still above the quality of typical conveyor sushi, and the garnishes were well done.‚òÅEUltimate Uni Comparative Tasting  2 Pieces 1,950 JPYHokkaido‚Äôs Bafun Uni and Murasaki Uni gunkan. Unfortunately, both were a bit melted, which was disappointing. I realized that even Onodera served this type of uni; it was a valuable experience in a way. Perhaps they didn‚Äôt use myoubank (an agent used to firm up uni)? Bafun uni had a mediocre flavor, while the murasaki uni was enjoyable and notably better than the seasonal murasaki uni I had previously tried at a directly managed shop on Rebun Island in Hokkaido.However, the appearance of the murasaki uni I had in February at a sushi shop in Aomori left a better impression.I decided to ask the young staff preparing the sushi about the origin, but when I asked for clarification, I received a somewhat curt response of ""Hokkaido,"" leaving me unable to gather details about the fishing port. While the tuna had its port displayed, the uni‚Äôs origin and port remained a mystery, which was a slight letdown. I wonder if it‚Äôs because this is a budget-friendly kaiten sushi place, or if even the higher-priced main branch engages in this level of service. Perhaps it was a question I shouldn‚Äôt have asked. As someone who trained rigorously in etiquette during my career to obtain three stars, it was a somewhat disappointing aspect of my experience.‚òÅEHomemade Simmered Anago  1 Piece 640 JPYOf course, the techniques of Edomae stand out. The reduction sauce was incredible, although the flavor of the anago itself was average (yet still vastly superior to typical chain conveyor sushi).‚òÅEHomemade Kohada  1 Piece 340 JPYI hesitated among saba, aji, and iwashi, but when it comes to Edomae, kohada is a must. It is noticeably better than chain store kohada, but I still think it could use a bit more visual appeal in preparation.‚òÅEKue Comparison  1,400 JPYWhile the staff gave some explanation upon serving, I couldn‚Äôt catch the details from their voice, so I remain unsure which kue this is or whether it‚Äôs wild or farmed, which left me a bit curious considering the previous experience with uni. In the end, I ate without fully understanding the meaning of ‚Äúcomparison.‚ÄÅEIt was good, but compared to the natural kue I had at a conveyor sushi place in Shingu City, Wakayama, I felt the taste of the fat was somewhat lacking. ‚òÅEGari  0 JPYI also ordered this through the tablet. I have never seen such beautiful gari in my life. Truly impressive.‚òÅEAburi Takabe  2 Pieces 650 JPYThis was introduced as a ""new item"". Takabe is a member of the Suzuki family. ‚ÄúTaka‚ÄÅErefers to rocky reefs, while ‚Äúbe‚ÄÅEmeans fish. While regarded as a premium fish in Kanto, it‚Äôs not commonly caught in my local area, so it‚Äôs popularity and availability is rather limited. Still, this offering truly represents what ""Onodera"" is about.For me, this was the highlight of the meal.‚òÅEYagara  2 Pieces 510 JPYThe staff proudly showcased a large yagaras. It was the biggest one I had ever seen.Finally, I tried Onodera's red rice (red vinegared rice). It is made with Hitomebore from Akita and aged and fermented using sake lees.Each grain stood out distinctly.I was truly impressed and felt fortunate to have eaten this red vinegared ricethis was the greatest takeaway from my visit. I was thrilled and deeply moved.Recently, I haven‚Äôt been able to enjoy sashimi as much as I used to, and sushi the same. But with this visit to Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, I proudly reaffirmed the deliciousness of Edomae sushi. The total bill of 7,150 JPY felt incredibly reasonable. I slightly regretted not trying the sea urchin sashimi, kelp-wrapped mackerel, and castella egg as well. In conclusion, I can eat delicious food endlessly, but only within the range of what I can afford.================Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch1F Il Palazzino Omotesando, 5-1-6 Jinguumae, Shibuya, TokyoTel: 050-3085-1700Closed: Irregular holidaysHours: 10:30-22:30(Last entry at 21:30, last order at 22:00)Seating: 31 Counter seats, 4 tables for 4, and 2 private rooms for 6, total of 59 seatsMake a reservation here.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

215,A tourist-friendly restaurant,"I visited on a Friday evening and the restaurant was about half full. It had a lot of couples seated at the counter. The atmosphere was brighter than I expected based on the photos. At the counter, there were paper towels and a full set of items typically found in kaiten sushi. I also noticed that the Japanese tea was the type where you pour hot water over powdered tea yourself. Since this place is known for its tuna, I initially ordered the medium fatty tuna and the recommended five pieces. Perhaps my expectations were too high; they were rather average. However, the freshness of the raw mackerel, live surf clams, and striped jack was delightful, and I enjoyed the mild flavor of the pickled ginger.

By 11:00, it was fully booked.The concept here is to enjoy the sushi from Ginza Onodera casually at a kaiten sushi restaurant. However, upon entering, I noticed that while the conveyor belt was moving, no sushi was actually circulating! Instead, there's a system where you order via a touchscreen and the sushi is delivered to your table.The quality of the sushi was excellent, and it was surprisingly reasonable given the quality.

On the way, I remembered that I hadn‚Äôt been to ""Onodera"" in a while, so I decided to drop by.I was able to enter without waiting. Here‚Äôs what I ordered, in the order they were served:- 2 pieces of Shima Aji (JPY 650) - Delicious!- 2 pieces of Shime Saba (JPY 440) - Unfortunately, the Shime Saba was disappointing again.

It had a relatively light flavor, which is understandable for tuna in March.- 1 Tuna Toro Takumaki (JPY 720) - It was okay.As I mentioned during my first visit, the sushi rice uses red vinegar, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. While the Shime Saba didn‚Äôt impress, the other fish was better than last time, and the anago exceeded my expectations.Spending JPY 3970 for lunch is certainly not cheap, but worthwhile.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

224,Surprising Bill After All-You-Can-Eat at Popular Kaiten Sushi in Omotesando?!,"After indulging in all-you-can-eat luxury sushi, I was shocked by the final bill...This restaurant, ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,"" was created with the concept of providing high-quality sushi in a more accessible way.I was able to enter without waiting, likely due to visiting on a weekday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets busy with tourists on weekends, requiring a longer wait.I started with the ""Luxury Shrimp Trio (JPY 980),"" ""Comparison of Kue (JPY 1400),"" and ""Two Pieces of Fresh Medium Fatty Tuna (JPY 620),"" along with some signature Japanese sake.The sake was served with a performance as it was poured over the counter, which I highly recommend!I continued to order dish after dish, enjoying what I desired.In total, I ended up eating about 20 plates alone. The highlights were the sea urchin comparison and the surf clam.While all the dishes were of much higher quality than standard conveyor belt sushi, the price also reflected that...It made me question the cost-performance ratio!However, the luxurious atmosphere in the Omotesando location is definitely enjoyable!And as for the total price... please check the last photo!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

225,When I hear about red vinegar...,"I heard they use red vinegar and wanted to try it at least once, so I visited on our wedding anniversary. It was estimated that I would wait for two hours after checking in through the touch panel, but I received a call after about an hour. Maybe it was because there was a 60-minute limit or other customers gave up, but I was guided to my seat sooner than expected. I went in the early evening, but there were quite a few items sold out. If you have something specific you want, I recommend arriving early.As for the red vinegar, I couldn't really discern its taste! The sushi was incredibly delicious However, I just couldn't taste the red vinegar at all. The seared engawa (flounder fin) truly impressed me.It's a must-try for engawa lovers!

It‚Äôs clear that this place is popular.The ordering was done via a touch panel, and the wait time from ordering to serving was quick. The staff's energy was quite impressive, which made the dining experience enjoyable.

Be prepared to wait at least an hour. Even though it‚Äôs a standing sushi spot, there are proper seats, so it feels more like a regular sushi restaurant.You can eat as much as you like for around JPY 6000 per person.It‚Äôs delicious, but the price reflects its quality.The fish is quite tasty, so I would say it's a good value for the money.However, be ready to wait for that long.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

229,"If there's no line, I would love to go back for the 'Yama Sachi Hon Maguro'...","On this day, I was invited by my family and initially planned to brave the queues, but there was a heavy snow warning from the morning.We agreed to postpone, but the weather forecast said the snow would stop in the afternoon...I confess that I made a reckless decision to go despite the snow warning. m(._.)mFortunately, there were no consequences to this decision, and it seems someone in my family has the luck of entering the restaurant without any wait even after 12 PM, and I was able to benefit from that bliss.To add to my good fortune, my payment for the day was covered by my second daughter...I must be the lucky one here! We were guided to our table and, all together, were welcomed with a lively, ""Welcome to Onodera!"" It made me realize once again that this is indeed a kaiten sushi place.The staff explained the store's system. The tea served is the standard powdered tea found in typical kaiten sushi restaurants, but a notable difference is that we can order gari (pickled ginger) and wasabi via tablet (which is free).In our family, we usually order only what each of us wants, so having one piece per plate is quite appreciated.‚ñ†Today's Orders  14 pieces + extras that I had:1. Yama K Hon Maguro Akami @ JPY 4202. Yama K Hon Maguro Chutoro @ JPY 6203. Homemade Stewed Anago @ JPY 6404. 2 pieces of Homemade Shime Saba @ JPY 4405. Homemade Kohada @ JPY 3406.

Homemade Castella Tamago @ JPY 290When I finished eating, I realized my biggest mistake!I forgot the winter yellowtail (KÂØí„Éñ„É™) (ÅEûÔºÅEIt‚Äôs a major blunder not to have it during this season.„ÄêYama K Maguro„ÄëNevertheless, the biggest selling point of ""Onodera"" is that Yama K's tuna is delicious.The akami (red meat) has a unique flavor that you typically don't experience at other kaiten sushi places, and I felt the delightful umami amidst a slight acidity (iron content).„ÄêKuruma Ebi„ÄëKuruma Ebi is quite rare in kaiten sushi restaurants. It was presented as a nigiri with the opened side facing up, which made me wonder if it was steamed shrimp by mistake.There must be a reason for this style of nigiri, but it remains unclear.Nonetheless, the flavor was undoubtedly that of Kuruma Ebi...„ÄêAnago„ÄëThere was plenty of simmered sauce, and everyone else‚Äôs anago had double the amount compared to mine. When anago is delicious, it definitely raises the mood, but there was only stewed fish on the menu.„ÄêShari„ÄëConsidering I had the tamagoyaki included, I felt I had about 15 pieces. The akazu (red vinegar) rice is on the smaller side, allowing for a satisfactory number of pieces. It‚Äôs a clever setup.As for the other toppings, starting from shime saba, I felt I understood why Toriton is so popular as it is on the same level. I think this is where you should come when you‚Äôre craving tuna.„ÄêStanding Sushi Ginza Onodera„ÄëWhen I asked where the standing sushi shop was, they informed me it‚Äôs next door. However, it wasn‚Äôt a standing-only shop; it had chairs, and it seemed to offer a better seating experience. When it's just two people, this place looks much cozier.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

230,Top-tier Kaiten Sushi (though it hardly rotates),"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera has been a hot topic as a sushi restaurant with a unique kaiten style. I visited at around 2:30 PM on a Friday, and since it was snowing lightly in the city, I was seated in less than five minutes.The restaurant was about 90% full, with around half of the guests being international touristsit's great to see them back!The quality of the fish and rice clearly surpasses typical kaiten sushi standards. In fact, while it‚Äôs a kaiten sushi place, the plates aren‚Äôt actually rotating (laughs). When it comes to quality, it rivals some of the finest sushi counters.Among the dishes I tried, I especially want to recommend the following:""Hon Maguro Chutoro"" The moment it hits your mouth, the fish melts beautifully. The appearance is stunning as well, which adds to the experience. The rice perfectly complements the chutoro.""Botan Ebi"" This had a nice firm texture and exceptional freshness. The sweetness of the shrimp was rich but not overwhelming, making it a wonderfully flavorful piece.""Meji Maguro"" I first tasted this at a high-end sushi restaurant in Sapporo about a month ago, and I‚Äôve been a fan ever since. It offers a different deliciousness compared to chutoro or akami,and the richness of the fat is outstanding. I highly recommend giving it a try.These were some of the highlights from my meal, but of course, the other selections were delicious as well. The rice served here is of a level you wouldn't typically find at a kaiten sushi place, and it's a pleasure to enjoy such high-quality sushi at a casual setting.I look forward to visiting again!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

233,Not that surprising!,"I had some time to spare before dinner at another restaurant, so I decided to stop by here as the places are very close to each other.I‚Äôve been curious about this famous tuna place for a while.Didn‚Äôt the company win the first auction for tuna this year as well?I arrived around 4:30 PM without a reservation and was seated right away!I ordered a beer, and the hand towel was nice.By registering on LINE, I got a complimentary piece of sea bream sashimi.I quickly placed my order for the Hon Maguro from Yamako.I chose the medium fatty tuna and red meat.The touch-screen ordering system is convenient and nice! My order came quite fast!Upon tasting it, I found it wasn‚Äôt quite as surprising as I expected.It was just ordinary, really.Well, tuna is tuna, right?I‚Äôve had first-rate tuna plenty of times, including ones from Oma.While the sushi had a nice touch, like using red vinegar, there are certainly better places that serve tastier sushi.If I had to pick the highlight, the purple sea urchin was delicious!It was definitely better than the horse manure sea urchin I had alongside it.One good point was that the dishes came out rather quickly.The drinks were served smoothly as well.However, the final dish, the raw shirasu (whitebait), was forgotten and just sat there without being served.Also, the sake was poured on the table instead of the counter, which was frustrating.But I kept quiet because I‚Äôve been a bit more relaxed lately.But still, it is bound to spill anyway!The girl who poured for me filled the masu cup to the brim, but doesn‚Äôt she realize it will overflow? Was she not trained?What a waste!!!Overall, the service was lacking! I wonder if they just cater to tourists or foreigners (*^^*)There are still plenty of restaurants that serve good sea urchin, so I probably won't come back here.It‚Äôs pricey too.Sorry about that!

235,Thick and juicy,"I had lunch with my sister in Omotesando at a kaiten sushi place I had been curious about for a while. Leaving my older siblings, who have a different sense of money due to chain restaurants, we visited with just adults and a baby.When we arrived on a weekday at 11 AM, there was already a line. It seems they open at 10:30 AM, but the restaurant was completely packed. Everyone must be having breakfast here.Initially, we managed to slip in as the third group, but more customers kept arriving afterward. During busy times, there seems to be a 90-minute limit, so turnover is not too bad.In addition to counter seating, there are box seats, which we aimed for this time since we had kids with us. There were also private rooms further back in the restaurant. I wonder if reservations can be made.We were seated about 15 minutes later, right around lunchtime.We ordered the day's recommendations and focused on tuna.With the registration as a LINE friend, we received a complimentary piece, which was a Spanish mackerel that day.‚òÅEold Sea BreamSeared Engawa‚òÅEmberjack‚òÅEreshly Caught Striped JackCold FlounderNakaochi GunkanTekka MakiToro-Taku Maki‚òÅEdishes marked were particularly delicious. Seasonal ingredients seemed to have the upper hand over tuna this time.Each piece was thick, allowing us to enjoy the sweetness from the texture. The Engawa was plump and searing it made the fat ooze out juicily. It was rich without being overly greasy, showcasing excellent quality.The Cold Sea Bream had substantial thickness and robust sweetness.The Striped Jack had a clean sweetness, with consistent flesh density. The Flounder was thick and it had a pleasantly soft elasticitynot tough, but rather cushiony, enhancing its sweetness. The Nakaochi had plenty as well, with the melting tuna fat giving a smooth mouthfeel. It had ample sweetness and paired well with soy sauce.Compared to other offerings, the Tekka was slightly less impressive in terms of the fish.The Toro-Taku Maki was delicious with its melting fat, but I felt it could have been a bit more fulfilling.There were also high-priced sushi pieces ranging from JPY 750 to JPY 1,200 each, but for our first time, we opted for the more affordable options. I was so impressed by the thickness of the nigiri rather than the gunkan or rolls, that I think I will try some fatty cuts or medium fatty tuna next time.

I've been interested in this place for a long time, and after a year, I decided to check it out as the crowd seemed to have thinned out.When I arrived around 6 PM, there were 40 groups ahead of me... I was quite anxious about whether I would get in before closing. It was a numbered system, so I took a number and waited. You can get tickets for both standing sushi and the conveyor belt, so I reserved both (but just to clarify, it‚Äôs neither conveyor nor standing). After spending 2 hours outside, I finally entered.While waiting inside, they were having an event featuring sea bream. I asked a staff member if it was still available, and they confidently said it was definitely fine, but by the time I sat down, they were sold out.First up was the first catch of tuna. It was simply delicious.Mackerel. Quite good.Toro-taku. Amazing.Seared salmon. Average.Shirako (cod milt). Exquisite.Kawahagi (filefish). Exquisite.Akaika (squid). Average.Anago (conger eel, which I forgot to mention). Absolutely delicious.By around 8 PM, many items were sold out, so I couldn't have everything I wanted, but overall the fish was fresh and of good quality. The red vinegar rice was also just the right hardness; I wasn't expecting it to be warm.It's easy to see why it‚Äôs popular.Considering the price range, I thought that even if I were to go to another sushi place in Ginza, I would choose Onodera at this location.This is the tricky part about dining with a group, but I was very satisfied.Aside from the announcements from the staff and the casual demeanor of the sushi chef who served me, I would rank this as the number one conveyor belt sushi place.I‚Äôll be back!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

239,Sushi Dinner at Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in Omotesando,"I tried the 'Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera' in Omotesando after enjoying the delicious 'Ginza Onodera Trymon' I mentioned earlier. Since it was just after New Year, I thought I might get some auspicious items as it was the time when Onodera had just won the most tuna at the auctions.The exterior of the restaurant is conveniently located just across from Apple, a short walk from Omotesando Station.There was a signboard celebrating the best tuna.Given it was a weekend night along with the slight easing of inbound travel restrictions, the place was very crowded, and I ended up waiting for about 1.5 hours. I later realized that I could have made a reservation through EPARK, but by the time I noticed, that day‚Äôs slots had already been filled.The interior had a dazzling atmosphere, offering a completely different vibe compared to Trymon.Ordering was done via a touch panel, and the chefs directly served the plates. Since the conveyor belt wasn't moving at all, it technically wasn't a true conveyor belt sushi experience. Here‚Äôs what I ordered:- Freshly auctioned tuna (akami and toro) for JPY 1040. I enjoyed my first taste of the season, limited to one plate per person.- Live-caught Kanpachi for JPY 540. It had a rich fat content but a firm texture.- Hirame (flounder) for JPY 620. I believe it was part of a limited-time offer announced in the restaurant.- Engawa (flounder fin) for JPY 440. It's one of my personal favorites, although it‚Äôs not cheap, and I expected it to be flounder rather than a flatfish.- Crab-flavored salad gunkan for JPY 230. A personal favorite of mine. It might be considered a kids' menu item, and they probably don't make the salad on-site, though.- Fresh salmon gunkan for JPY 420. I don‚Äôt recall it making a strong impression.- Fresh sardine for JPY 450. Despite being a blue fish, it was surprisingly fatty and tender.- Homemade marinated mackerel rolled with kombu for JPY 640. I wasn‚Äôt too sure about this one.- Special natto maki for JPY 290. It came topped with plum and bonito flakes, allowing for three different tastes.- Anago cucumber maki for JPY 640. The cucumber was perfectly textured.- Kappa maki for JPY 280. Although it was just a kappa maki, the cucumber was finely sliced, making it quite different from the usual version.Overall, the quality and taste of the sushi and toppings were impressive. However, I did notice that the rice was cold and somewhat compacted, which was a bit concerning. I couldn't discern if they used the same ingredients as Trymon, but I missed the warm, fluffy texture of the rice that breaks apart nicely in your mouth.The prices were on the higher side, and while I think it‚Äôs undoubtedly delicious for a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, I was expecting a taste closer to Trymon's, which left me with slightly different expectations.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

241,Delicious sushi that's easy to enjoy in Omotesando,"As I was running errands in Omotesando, it started to get dark, and I thought it was about time for dinner. That's when I noticed this place. It‚Äôs quite a famous sushi restaurant; I had seen it featured on TV when it first opened, and I had been curious about it for a while. Being a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, it seemed easy to grab just a few plates, which is perfect for someone like me who doesn‚Äôt eat a large quantity. I quickly went inside and took a waiting card. Since I arrived a bit earlier, there was only one group ahead of me, and I got seated right away. The counter is arranged in a circle around the sushi chefs, and the ceiling is lined with round light bulbs that resemble those seen on squid fishing boats from the past. The seating is a bit snug, and I could see myself hesitating if the number of plates increased. I used the green tea powder and hot water system available at the table to make my tea. Ordering is done through a touch panel. I took my time browsing the menu, considering today‚Äôs recommendations along with some tuna. I selected shimesaba (vinegared mackerel) and buri (yellowtail) from the recommendations. It seems they are particularly proud of their tuna, sourced from high-end suppliers. I also decided to try the negitoro (minced tuna with green onion) since I was there. The shimesaba was marinated in a pleasantly tangy vinegar. It tasted great, with just the right balance, so much so that I debated whether to add soy sauce or not, given the nice vinegary flavor. The buri was incredibly fresh and had a great texture. Thanks to the finely executed knife work, the firm sashimi was easy to chew and enjoy. The tuna had a rich flavor with a hint of sweetness that stood out. There was none of that watery texture you might find in thawed fish; the tender pieces, carefully sliced, paired excellently with soy sauce. I typically don‚Äôt eat that much, and since each piece was fulfilling, I left satisfied. It was a great meal!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

242,Authentic Red Rice Kaiten Sushi: Exceptional location and atmosphere! An entertainment-style sushi restaurant that transcends traditional conveyor belt sushi.,"On December 12, 2022, the kanji character representing the state of the nation for the year was decided to be ""War."" Out of approximately 220,000 total votes, ""War"" received 10,804 votes. I wonder if there's any meaning to this tradition we do every year? Well, as long as everyone enjoys it, I'm happy. Hello! The only thing on my mind every day is ""Food,"" this is Takumon  Today, I'm heading to „Äê[ÂªªËª¢ÈÆ® ÈäÄÂ∫ß„Åä„ÅE„Åß„ÇÅEÊú¨Â∫ó](https://onodera-group.com/kaitensushi-ginza/)„ÄÅE It's about a 3-minute walk from Omotesando Station.

We wanted to bring the quality cultivated in ""[ÈÆ® ÈäÄÂ∫ß „Åä„ÅE„Åß„Çâ](13153824)"" to a wider audience, so you can enjoy ‚Äúgenuine Edomae sushi‚ÄÅEin a kaiten sushi style. I visited on a weekend afternoon. At first, I planned to quickly investigate a sushi restaurant near Harajuku that has been featured in commercials. However, to my surprise, there was a 140-minute wait. No way, that's over the top! Is it really that popular? I haven't been there yet... I guess I'll go on a weekday instead. So, I became a sushi refugee. But I was already fully set on sushi, so I consulted a foodie friend. They gave me several recommendations. Thank you, Oligosaccharide (¬¥‚àÄÅEÄ*) It's nearby, so I decided to check this place out. Is this the famous Ginza Onodera? Seriously? Sounds great! Oh, I cross the signal in front of [Apple Omotesando](https://www.apple.com/jp/retail/omotesando/) to get to a narrow path. Easy to find. By the way, I can't even buy the latest iPhone in a store yet...? The exterior of Onodera is lovely. The lighting is stylish. Standing sushi? Wait, it's standing to eat? I was shocked by the sign outside, but once I peeked inside, people were seated. Phew. Thank goodness. There seems to be standing areas, but there are also box tables and private rooms. That's a relief. There were no guests waiting outside. It seems like heading there early on weekends is a good idea. Inside, there were a few customers waiting. First, I registered the number of people using the ""waiting ticket machine"" near the entrance. I pressed the button. This setup is becoming quite common these days. What's nice is that you don‚Äôt have to wait there the whole time. By registering your phone number, you'll be notified when your turn is approaching. Oh, this is nice! So, I entered my number. But it looks like I can wait in the seating area, so I decided to sit down. Just as I sat down, the phone rang. From 050-8882-‚óã‚óã‚óã‚óã. Hello? Who is this? Hello? Santa? After a while, a robotic voice said, ""Your turn is coming up soon."" There‚Äôs a bit of a delay, but it‚Äôs quite efficient, though it ended up being meaningless lol A few minutes later, I was shown to my seat. Wow, inside is a large U-shaped counter. There are chefs in the center. It‚Äôs beautiful and has a cool vibe unique to Omotesando with the sparkling ceiling. The seating is simple and quite nice. I order via a touchpad. During checkout, I‚Äôll bring the blue number plate to the register. It‚Äôs kaiten sushi, so there‚Äôs a conveyor belt, but the sushi toppings aren‚Äôt rotating. Only plates with writing are going around. Hmm, this is fine, but it feels a bit lonely. Opinions might differ on this, but personally, I don't mind it not moving. Given the times we‚Äôre in... that just makes it an ordinary sushi restaurant, haha. The tea is served with a ladle. The taste is consistent and delicious, and the water temperature isn‚Äôt too hot. There‚Äôs Wi-Fi. The restrooms are separate for men and women, clean, and functional.  What I had today (selected items): - „Äê[„ÇÅEÅæÂπ∏ Êú¨„Éû„Ç∞„É≠Â§ß„Éà„É≠](b)„ÄÅE30Right off the bat, what a dynamite choice! (Laughs)Being able to eat tuna from Yamako is seriously impressive.It comes pre-seasoned, no soy sauce needed.It practically vanished in my mouth the moment I took a bite.So delicious! The sushi rice is made with red vinegar.It‚Äôs rare to find red vinegar at kaiten sushi places.They offer different portion sizes, but the standard size felt a bit small. The real tuna from Yamako seems to be quite popular and sells out quickly, so it's recommended to order early. - „Äê[Áúü„ÅÑ„Çè„Åó](b)„ÄÅE20So good. For two pieces at this price, it‚Äôs quite reasonable.The portion size is also decent. I thought about ordering another but it was already sold out...

When I ordered a sake just to drink, the staff came to me and said, ""Would you like some cheers?"" ""Uh, okay, sure,"" I said without really knowing why.And to my surprise, they poured directly from a one-sho bottle into a masu. ""Yes, let‚Äôs go! More! That‚Äôs right, more!!"" The enthusiasm echoed throughout the restaurant. Plus, the conveyor belt stopped during that time. Wow, this is a great service. I even filmed it in action mode in 4K. But everyone around was watching, and as a shy person, I felt a little embarrassed... Just kidding!! Maybe I should order another glass? (¬¥‚àÄÅEÄ) Haha! But it seemed like the other customers weren‚Äôt ordering much? What‚Äôs going on?‚Ä¶ But, this is a good service! By the way, they also have Juyondai sake. Also, the selection of wines and other alcohol is plentiful. Great for someone like me who loves to drink. The most expensive item is 120,000? I wonder if there are secret menu items... To finish, I slurped up some salt-flavored ramen. It was a small serving, just a bite. Wow, Onodera‚Äôs ramen is quite interesting. It‚Äôs a common menu item at kaiten sushi places, but it was really tasty. I ordered this, and when I checked the menu, it was already sold out. Since the seating is limited to 90 minutes, I headed to pay about that time. I was pleasantly surprised that it was cheaper than I had imagined! Considering we were drinking and eating, the price was quite reasonable. By the time we left, there were already plenty of waiting customers outside. Kaiten sushi... It seems like this place would appeal to both Japanese and foreigners. You can feel the hospitality, and the taste is superb. I left satisfied and enjoyed my time. Now, let's buy some dessert on the way home... Thank you for the meal!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

For some reason, only one side was sliced, but since it‚Äôs a firmer fish, having it properly cut would make it easier to eat.The Chutoro was also very tasty, living up to the restaurant‚Äôs reputation for excellent tuna!The Salmon Harami had a nice amount of fat, and the large piece was very enjoyable.The house-made Pickled Mackerel wrapped in kombu had a bit of a fishy taste lingering.I noticed a slight fishy odor when I tried the tempura eel here previously, so they may not be great at handling fish that tends to have a stronger smell.Since I kept it light, my bill came to just over JPY 2000.I love Shima Aji, so I definitely want to come back!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

249,Prefer standing sushi over conveyor belt,"The standing sushi and the kaiten sushi are separated. I was immediately drawn to the standing option, and it turned out to be a fantastic choice.

This is where the renowned Onodera is located. Since they used to occupy the same building, I often visited here.With kaiten sushi, the show begins. The chef performs with a giant octopus leg, using a microphoneit‚Äôs quite entertaining. I tried several items that are exclusive to the kaiten section; the anago (saltwater eel) was completely different from what I had at the standing sushi. While the sourcing was excellent, the initial preparation could use some work, as it had a slimy texture, and the seasoning felt commercially made.The kombu rolls, bonito, seared engawa, tamago (egg), and salad rolls were decent, though the price to value ratio wasn't great. If you're going to eat kaiten sushi, I'd recommend sticking to the fatty tuna.You should definitely head to the counter. Although it's called standing sushi, you can actually sit down, and the quality of ingredients is superb, which is unexpected for standing sushi. As expected of Onodera, they source top-quality fish. The standing sushi here is likely among the best in the country.

My apologies for that.So, I quickly searched for a nearby spot and ended up here.On a weekday at around 7 PM, the restaurant was about 60-70% full. It felt like there were quite a few foreign patrons and younger customers, likely due to the location.Now, what I had included:Seasonal TempuraBelly TunaSquidOctopusAosa Seaweed SoupSteamed ShrimpSalmon RoeToro-Taku, and more.I received a free Engawa (flounder fin) as a service when I sent a friend request on LINE.There was also a time-limited promotion offering Nakaochi (the fatty part from the collar of the fish) at a discount.Overall, while the good dishes were quite delicious, some were disappointing. Price doesn‚Äôt seem to matter much here. The relatively inexpensive items on the menu, like squid and octopus, were not bad, while the tempura had a decent batter, but the ingredients felt a bit soggy.It was a bit of a shame, but this place seems like it could significantly improve with just a few changes.

This place is on a different level compared to regular kaiten sushi.Although it's a kaiten sushi, due to the pandemic, they had a system to order your dishes. All orders were made using the touch panel right in front of me.I had some appetizers and fried octopus, along with several pieces of sushi.As for the sushi, I wonder if I had set my expectations too high?

258,[Delicious Tuna] Onodera's Challenge Kaiten Sushi,"Our restaurant, Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, opened in Omotesando in 2021 as part of the famous sushi chain ""Onodera"" in Ginza.

259,High-End Sushi without the Conveyor Belt,"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera has its main branch in Ginza, and it's known for its standing sushi and kaiten sushi restaurants. I've heard a lot about it for a while and have been curious, but I hadn't had the chance to visit until now, and finally made it to this kaiten sushi.This restaurant doesn't accept reservations, and due to its immense popularity, you must wait in line on weekends. However, they do distribute numbered tickets and provide estimated wait times, so the stress of waiting is minimized. Located right next to Omotesando, you can enjoy some window shopping while passing the time.I got a numbered ticket before noon and was seated in about 30 minutes.After pedaling for an hour on my bicycle, I was really hungry, feeling like my stomach would touch my back. Since I‚Äôd be cycling a lot today, I wouldn't gain any weight no matter how much I ate.I came with three friends, and we ordered a variety of dishes, so I'll share a digest version. I‚Äôve left longer comments on the items that stood out to me. Prices range from around JPY 300 for the cheaper plates to about JPY 800 for the more expensive ones. If you eat without worrying about the cost, you can expect to eat approximately 12-13 plates, bringing the total to about JPY 8,000 per person.By the way, although the name includes ""kaiten"" (rotating), there are no sushi plates rotating in the restaurant. You order via a tablet, and the staff directly serves the sushi over the counter. Honestly, even if the sushi was rotating, I wouldn‚Äôt take from it, so this style works just fine for me.Boiled shrimp. This was quite ordinary.Yamako's tuna (akami). As expected from Yamako, the fish itself is delicious. However, you can see that the quality of the preparation is just average. They might be training disciples while running the business. The use of red vinegar while serving is definitely exciting.Buri (yellowtail).Kanpachi. The fat content was great, showcasing the high quality of the ingredient itself.Sea bream.Horse mackerel. It had no unpleasant smell and was a reliably tasty aji. I indeed prefer blue fish.Grilled salmon. The piece was large, with good marbling, delivering an understandable deliciousness. I started to realize that enjoying flavors mainly comes from such substantial ingredients rather than intricate techniques.A gunkan (battleship-style sushi) overflowing with ikura (salmon roe), it offered a direct approach with the raw ingredients. The quality of the roe was nice, making it a simply delicious dish.Tekka maki (tuna rolls). This was excellent! Compared to other items, it felt relatively cheaper, making it quite appealing. The rolled sushi here is a great deal.Sweet shrimp. This was a huge win, as three large sweet shrimp were served. The unique texture of the sweet shrimp together with the red vinegar rice was superb, and the flavor of the shrimp lingered pleasantly in my mouth after swallowing. Personally, I love Sushiro, but this cannot be compared with the tiny pieces from the hundred-yen sushi (which is natural).Grilled kinmedai (fatty sea bream). This presentation is a rarity at a sushi shop, but it was another success. Kinmedai is often associated with stewing, but since it‚Äôs a very delicious fish, grilling is my favorite way to enjoy it. However, the quality of the preparation definitely differs depending on the ingredient, so there are some good chefs here. Seasonal ingredients that require such care are likely prepared by skilled artisans.White shrimp. Another hit! A generous serving of flavorful white shrimp was piled on the rice.To finish, we had nodoguro (black throat sea perch). It was extremely delicious, but I couldn‚Äôt help but compare it to the nodoguro I had recently at Sushi Ju, which was just too good.It was a great meal. I don‚Äôt think this is a place that wins with intricate techniques; rather, it competes based on the quality of the ingredients and their size, accompanied by bold and straightforward flavors. Although the initial menu had a number of questionable items for the price, I was glad that I met some good ingredients toward the end.That said, if asked about cost performance, I would raise some doubts. Nowadays, you can enjoy quite high-quality sushi for under JPY 10,000 in the city for lunch. Considering it‚Äôs located in a prime area of Omotesando, some price justification is understandable, but it‚Äôs best to approach this restaurant with the mindset of indulging in large portions of sushi.","Here are the words that represent the reviewer's impressions:

I wasn't sure if it's meant to be a side dish or a dessert, so I just ate it during my meal.The bonito and tuna, which are two of my favorites, were delicious. However, I realized that if I kept ordering, my solo lunch bill might get out of hand, so I ordered ramen to balance things out. I had low expectations for ramen at a conveyor belt sushi place, but it turned out to be as good as recommended.‚òÅEecommendation Point!!‚òÅEhey offer coupons if you register on LINE.I couldn't help but think that if I worked a little harder, I could afford a delicious non-conveyor belt sushi lunch.

261,A welcoming kaiten sushi restaurant where you can enjoy authentic flavors.,"I visited a top-notch Edomae sushi restaurant in Ginza, now accessible at a reasonable price in Omotesando, thanks to a friend's recommendation on a weekday evening.Walking along the main street of Omotesando towards Aoyama-dori, you'll find the restaurant right after turning into the street between ""HUGO BOSS"" and ""COACH.""""Ginza Onodera,"" which aims to convey refined Japanese culture to the world through its cuisine, opened a branch in Omotesando last October.While just hearing ""Ginza"" often evokes a sense of prestige, ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" offers a friendly kaiten sushi style that appeals to everyone, especially younger customers.Given its location in an upscale area, the restaurant has a calm and sophisticated atmosphere, with prices slightly above the average kaiten sushi.However, it remains easy to enjoy high-quality Edomae sushi at a reasonable price, making it a convenient choice for many.Although it‚Äôs called kaiten sushi, only the menu signs are revolving. You place your orders using the panels set at your table.There are counter and table seats. Since we were a party of four, we opted for a table, but it was bustling and likely to fill up by 6 PM.The bright and clean interior creates a comfortable and tranquil ambiance.The red vinegar sushi rice and generous toppings make each piece exceptionally delicious. The authentic tuna from ""Yama Ko"" in Toyosu features a medium fatty tuna (2 pieces for JPY 620) and lean tuna (JPY 420). The homemade fish broth is also exquisite.‚òÅEThe daily special sushi today featured kampachi, bonito, and shimaaji.‚òÅEAburi nodoguro, medium fatty tuna, engawa, salmon, scallop, sea urchin, akagai, shime saba, and toro-taku rolls were promptly served as we continued to order.I requested smaller sushi rice portions, which allowed me to savor the fresh flavors of each topping.It was a great meal.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

The Toro-Taku roll was easy to eat, and the fresh scallops were definitely worth a repeat visit.I was also impressed to see a beautiful woman sitting at the counter by herself, enjoying a drinkhow cool! Initially, I thought that for conveyor sushi, Mitori Sushi would be a better choice. However, this place has its own unique character and offers a wonderful experience. The female sushi chef did an excellent job as well.If I had to point out a downside, I would say the cleanliness could use a little improvement.

The Nakaochi Gunkan and Toro-taku roll were also delicious.The Engawa was impressively large, overflowing from the plate, and had great fat content.The Anago didn't have that fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth texture; instead, it felt firmer. The hint of yuzu added a nice touch.The shining fish options (Kohada, Shime Saba, Aji) were tasty, but they didn‚Äôt exceed my expectations.Compared to other gourmet conveyor belt sushi places, the prices here are somewhat on the higher side.

265,"Great value for the price, fresh octopus is amazing!","This high-end sushi restaurant that also offers conveyor and standing dining is celebrating its first anniversary this October. It's located just around the corner from the COACH store at Omotesando A1 exit. I visited on a weekday before 2 PM.There are different machines for reception depending on whether you're choosing conveyor sushi or standing dining. As it was my first visit, I was unsure which to pick, so I directly asked the staff member which option was more affordable. She informed me that the conveyor sushi is about 10% cheaper, so I went with that option. Since there were no customers waiting, I thought it would have been nice if someone offered assistance while I stood in front of the machine for over a minute.Once seated, I placed my order through the touch panel right in front of me. It was a slow time with few people around, and the unique red vinegar rice nigiri came out quickly. The most popular choice, medium fatty tuna for JPY 620 each, was absolutely delicious. As a fan of live octopus, I couldn't resist the active octopus with two pieces for JPY 420. The thickness is something you wouldn't find in regular conveyor sushi, and although tender, it had a perfect bounce.The mackerel, two pieces for JPY 420, was also expertly deboned... I feel embarrassed admitting that I usually only eat cheaper options. Overall, I enjoyed sushi toppings that matched the generous amounts of red vinegar rice. However, it took over 10 minutes for the final tuna rolls to come out, so it seems that rolls may take longer to prepare.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

On this day, I was able to enter without waiting. The interior still looks new and well-maintained, as it's been less than a year since the opening. Orders are placed using a touch panel device located at each seat. Although it's a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, the sushi doesn't actually rotate; everything is ordered via the device. I enjoyed about 10 pieces of sushi, including scallops, anago (conger eel), uni (sea urchin), and of course, the main attraction, the honmaguro (bluefin tuna). The tuna was truly exceptional. Even the fatty part (otoro) was not overly greasy and had a refined sweetness. Just for the chance to taste this tuna, it's worth a visit. All items are priced under JPY 1000 per piece. In terms of enjoying high-quality sushi at a reasonable price, this may be an interesting concept.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

268,Happy 1st Anniversary!,"I've been going to the Kaiten Sushi at Omotesando lately, so I made a lunch reservation at the Ginza flagship store for next Saturday (^ ^).I discovered on Twitter that Onodera is holding a 1st-anniversary event from the 7th to the 10th!!Come to think of it, I first heard about the opening last October.I thought it was quite a feat to open during the pandemic, but they‚Äôve been operating continuously,I finally visited for the first time this year, and today is my fourth visit.I‚Äôm excited to enjoy the sushi again after a long time (ÅEæ‚óÅEºæ).The prices for nigiri have become more reasonable, and [b: the draft beer is half price!!]I wish Onodera would advertise more ( œÅE).So, I‚Äôve changed my plans last minute and decided to go to Kaiten Sushi Onodera!!I woke up early and took a 1.5-hour walk as a pre-meal workout!!As I sneak through the stylish Omotesando, a not-so-flashy old guy like me is moving ‚Ä¶ There are so many cute people here („ÄÉœâ„ÄÅE.It‚Äôs just a short walk from Omotesando Station, which is great.Even though I arrived right after the opening, it‚Äôs the 1st anniversary, so the place is pretty crowded („ÄÄÅEü–¥ÅEÅE.As always, the staff kindly guided me to my seat.I learned that when entering from the right side, the staff will push your chair in for you (ÅE£ ÅE£).But I still moved the chair myselfit‚Äôs just too embarrassing („ÄÉœâ„ÄÅE(„ÄÉœâ„ÄÅE(„ÄÉœâ„ÄÅE.I couldn‚Äôt chat much with the itamae (sushi chef) since they were busy, but that‚Äôs understandable (o^^o).Looking at the touch panel, it indeed shows that nigiri is a bit cheaper now.The menu has also expanded compared to before.

As a fan of fatty fish, I found the salmon, engawa, sardine, and chutoro to be the best.Each had a rich fattiness that melted in my mouth.Seasonal items like Ishigakigai and Maokarei were also fresh and delicious.My favorite here is the ara soup. It‚Äôs loaded with meaty pieces from the fish bones and has no unpleasant odorjust wonderful.When you order the Taito sake, all the staff come together to cheer.

271,Choose what you want to enjoy,"Since it's been a hot topic, I definitely wanted to give it a try.I have an appointment near Omotesando that should wrap up around 10:30. So, I planned to skip breakfast and thought about this place for brunch.Arriving just before the 11:00 opening time, I was surprised to find that it was already open. It seems they've changed the opening time to 10:30 from July 1st. I was able to get in without a wait.‚óÅEChawanmushi (Steamed Egg Custard)I thought this would be great to taste the dashi (broth), so I decided to start with it. As expected, it‚Äôs tailored for kaiten sushi (conveyor belt sushi). It‚Äôs better than average, but considering it's 510 JPY, you can‚Äôt expect the top-notch ingredients for the dashi. It's unreasonable to set high expectations.‚óÅEIkijime Mako-garei (Recommended)This is delicious. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd find this at regular kaiten sushi places.‚óÅEKobore Namashirasu (Also recommended)Well, it‚Äôs probably not fresh from the morning, so it's just okay. It wasn‚Äôt incredibly delicious either. I recently had some amazing fresh ones in Shizuka, so perhaps my expectations were too high. I should have skipped this one since the portion was quite large.‚óÅEAra-jiru (Fish Bone Soup)This is good. There‚Äôs a huge piece of yellowtail or a large fish from its family in there, nicely cleaned with no unpleasant smell. The fish itself is substantial and filling. This 510 JPY feels like a real bargain. However, there are photos of sold-out items in the menu, so be cautious.‚óÅEHon-Maguro Akami (Bluefin Tuna)This seems to be the highlight. The Hon-Maguro here is cut generously, and at 420 JPY per piece, it‚Äôs quite a steal.‚óÅEKohada (Gizzard Shad)It‚Äôs just so-so. I think it might be a bit too vinegary.‚óÅEAnago and Cucumber RollThis was a disappointment. Perhaps it was rolled by an apprentice, as it fell apart and the filling was unbalanced. This 620 JPY feels disrespectful.I wanted to try the shime-saba (marinated mackerel), but I don‚Äôt have confidence in finishing two more pieces. I was already full from the ara-jiru and the kobore namashirasu. Plus, being at Onodera, I couldn‚Äôt resist starting with the chawanmushi. So, feeling a little regretful, I decided to take away the saba bzushi (mackerel sushi).I just got home and tried a piece for my afternoon snack. Unfortunately, this was also disappointing. The mackerel was thick and perfectly marinated, beautifully wrapped in oboro (thinly sliced fish). The rice was tasty as well. Still, there was a slight flavor of mayonnaise between the fish and rice that ruined everything. What have they done to my beloved saba sushi? I'm so disappointed.It‚Äôs a small point, but for older patrons, having items served in pairs makes it difficult to sample a variety by yourself. I checked the menu thoroughly. If you get used to it and know what to choose, it seems you could easily return for another visit.Total spent in the restaurant: 3,400 JPYSaba bzushi takeaway: 3,240 JPYI was able to experience a trendy place much sooner than I usually would, and I‚Äôm thoroughly satisfied with that.","Here are the words representing the reviewers' impressions:

I ordered sardines; the fish quality was good, but I was shocked to find the ginger accompaniment was pre-packaged, ready-to-use ginger.

Of course, I couldn't just leave it at that.I decided to check out a restaurant I've been wanting to visit for a long time for lunch.I arrived at 'Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,' located just a 1-minute walk west from Exit A1 of Tokyo Metro Omotesando Station.In 2021, this restaurant made headlines by winning the top bid for tuna at the first auction held at Toyosu Market, breaking the stronghold that Sushi Zanmai had dominated yearly.They have been collaborating with 'Yama Ko,' a tuna wholesaler considered the best in Japan, securing the top tuna for four consecutive years.This establishment opened in October 2021 as a new brand run by ONODERA Food Service, with the head chef Sakagami overseeing it, aiming to make the quality cultivated at 'Sushi Ginza Onodera' accessible for everyone.Since the hair salon is nearby, I've passed by this restaurant many times and had been curious about it since before it opened.I thought it would be open by the time I next visited the salon, so I stopped by to see how things were going, only to find quite a long line!Apparently, it was featured on TV.It's particularly hard to go to restaurants in Tokyo without visiting before they get media attention.After checking it out a few more times over the next six months, I finally got a chance to visit.I arrived just before opening and registered at the E-PARK machine in front of the restaurant.With only about six customers ahead of me, I knew I could get in right away when my turn came.I waited on a free bench outside until the opening time.As more people started to gather just before opening, I waited near the entrance for my registration number to be called.Eventually, it was my turn, so let‚Äôs head inside.The interior is dazzling and luxurious. While this is a revolving sushi restaurant, there was no sushi rotating on the conveyor belt, and instead, orders were placed using a touchpad, with freshly made sushi served to us.The restaurant quickly filled up, and a line formed outside.The atmosphere inside is extravagant and luxurious.It may feel a bit flashy, but considering there is inbound demand, this level of expression could be acceptable.I was seated near the corner of the U-shaped counter.„ÉªMenuThe sushi is ordered via the touchpad. The star item sourced through their collaboration with Yama Ko is, of course, the tuna.The lineup features visually extravagant toppings, and there is a sense of performance with each dish.There are many options for nigiri and gunkan, making it quite tricky to choose.Similar to a conveyor belt sushi shop, ramen and other side dishes are also available, which sets it apart from high-end sushi restaurants.It seems they offer a decent selection of alcoholic beverages, but since I was just before my hair appointment, I decided to hold off this time.This time, I won‚Äôt comment on each dish but will express my personal evaluation as ‚óé‚óã‚ñ≥√ÅE‚óèKinmedai (Bream) ‚óã‚óèHouse-made Kobako (Baby Gobo) ‚ñ≥‚óèEngawa (Flounder Fin) ‚ñ≥ ‚óèOverflowing Shirasu Gunkan ‚ñ≥‚óèYama Ko Premium Akami (Lean Tuna) ‚óã‚óèThick Live Scallop ‚óÅE‚óèAkika (Red Squid) ‚óÅE‚óèHouse-made Shime Saba ‚ñ≥‚óèYama Ko Premium Chutoro (Medium Fat Tuna) ‚óÅE‚óèOverflowing Ikura Gunkan ‚óã‚óèYama Ko Premium Otoro (Fatty Tuna) ‚óÅE‚óèBafun Uni (Sea Urchin) Small Bowl ‚óã‚óèHouse-made Cooked Anago (Sea Eel) ‚ñ≥ ‚óèYama Ko Premium Torotaku Hosomaki (Roll) ‚ñ≥Although it operates as a conveyor sushi restaurant, being able to enjoy 'Onodera' brand sushi at relatively reasonable prices might be beneficial for many customers.However, while I found the tuna sourced through Yama Ko and some toppings delicious, there were definitely some disappointing items as well.As someone living in the Shonan area, I was particularly let down by the sushi made with deteriorated raw shirasu that had become mushy; I wish they hadn‚Äôt served this at such a venue.Of course, keeping the freshness of shirasu, even when provided locally, is challenging, so it‚Äôs fair to say that offering raw shirasu in Tokyo is quite rare and valuable, but I felt it was better not to serve disappointing sushi at all.While they serve sushi at affordable prices compared to high-end sushi places, it may be labeled as quite expensive compared to ordinary conveyor sushi restaurants. Therefore, given the high expectations and large customer turnout, I hope they strive to offer truly delicious sushi.„ÄêKaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Store„ÄÅE-1-6 Jingumae, Shibuya-ku, TokyoIl Palazzino Omotesando 1FTEL 050-3085-170010:30 AM - 10:30 PM (Last Entry 9:30 PM, Last Order 10:00 PM)Irregular Holidays","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

You can park right in front of the building as well.However, if you visit outside peak hours, you might miss out on the exciting tuna cutting show, and there will be fewer sushi chefs available.The main attraction here is that they use the same high-quality ingredients as their luxury sushi restaurants, especially the tuna from the ""Yamakou"" brand, which you can enjoy at a reasonable price. That's what brings me here today, primarily to enjoy the tuna.As I entered, it had all the familiar trappings of a kaiten sushian ordering tablet and powdered tea were readily available. The level of detail in their setup is impressive! However, none of the sushi plates were circulating; it seems they prepare them freshly upon ordering. Given the current circumstances, I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable grabbing plates that had been rotating in front of others.I noticed the selection of tuna was somewhat limited, so I decided to order a little bit of everything. They had hosomaki (thin rolls), but no futomaki (thick rolls), which was a bit disappointing.As for the tuna from ""Yamakou,"" I couldn't find the familiar yellow paper indicating its origin and weight on that day. If you‚Äôre going to promote ""Yamakou,"" they should proudly display that information. Unfortunately, the staff didn‚Äôt offer any details, leaving me a bit concerned.I placed an order for akami (lean tuna), zuke (marinated tuna), and chutoro (medium fatty tuna). I was curious to see how they would turn out, but the dishes arrived almost immediatelymuch quicker than expected! Other reviews noted longer wait times, so it seems there may be quite a variance depending on customer volume.The akami was good.The zuke was... interesting?The chutoro was the best of what I ordered today.The otoro (fatty tuna) was a bit lacking. The hosomaki with toro-taku was alright too.Overall, the chutoro stood out as my favorite among the tuna I tried.This place might have a mixed reception depending on the visitor. One might classify it as an upscale kaiten sushi or a casual offshoot of a high-end sushi restaurant since it doesn‚Äôt serve rotating plates. Their company strategy appears to target a unique niche in an industry divided between luxury and extremely affordable sushi, leaving us diners a bit confused as to how we should classify it.Regarding operation, when the restaurant is less busy, everything I ordered arrived promptly. Depending on the crowd and your pace, you may need to order accordingly. If it‚Äôs crowded, planning your orders ahead might be beneficial.As for the sushithe cutting, presentation, and seasoning was all a bit haphazard; as others have noted, the rice frequently spills from the sushi. The height of the hosomaki cuts varied as well.What stood out most to me was the temperature. Both the fish and rice were far too cold, which detracted from the tuna's quality. After receiving my dishes, I let them sit for a bit to reach room temperature before diving in.If you‚Äôre thinking of it as typical kaiten sushi, the casual vibe might seem fitting, but considering it‚Äôs priced more than double that of some chain kaiten sushi, that‚Äôs where the disconnect comes in.While it should feature quality ingredients like those at fine establishments, the fact that it‚Äôs presented as ""Edomae"" sushi brings the carelessness of the preparation into sharper focus.Quality of fish is important, but this experience reminded me that craftsmanship""shigoto""is crucial as well.By the way, the Onodera Group has remarkable initiatives supporting sushi chefs‚ÄÅEtraining and development. I imagine some of those academy graduates are working at this experimental location? So, if that‚Äôs the case, you might find that you‚Äôre enjoying slightly more affordable sushi made by students still adjusting to real-life restaurant conditions. Thus, I think it‚Äôs reasonable to support Onodera's efforts while enjoying reasonably priced, delicious tuna to your heart's content!However, ordering too much otoro can add up quickly, and at that point, you might as well go for a more straightforward, budget-friendly sushi lunch instead. If you spent the same amount at a chain kaiten sushi, you‚Äôd likely be able to eat plenty.It‚Äôs clear that evaluations might differ amongst patrons.Nonetheless, as a kaiten sushi experience, it generally meets basic expectations.It was a great meal.COVID-19 safety measures rating: 3","Here are the words that represent the reviewer's impressions:

280,Everything was delicious today except for the mackerel.,"I initially planned to visit a hamburger place called ""Yosh"" that just opened on the 16th, but it was temporarily closed, so I headed towards Omotesando Hills. On the way, I remembered that I hadn‚Äôt been to ""Onodera"" in a while, so I decided to drop by.I was able to enter without waiting. Here‚Äôs what I ordered, in the order they were served:- 2 pieces of Shima Aji (JPY 650) - Delicious!- 2 pieces of Shime Saba (JPY 440) - Unfortunately, the Shime Saba was disappointing again. The last time, the fish wasn‚Äôt great either...- 1 piece of Kohada (JPY 340) - The Kohada today was quite good.- 1 piece of Mackerel (JPY 280) - The mackerel was decent today.- 1 piece of Horse Mackerel (JPY 280) - The horse mackerel was excellent today.- 1 piece of Simmered Anago (JPY 640) - I believe this was my first time having the simmered anago here, and it was soft and flavorful, well-prepared with a rich glaze.- 2 pieces of Medium Fatty Tuna (JPY 620) - Was it about the size of a medium one? It had a relatively light flavor, which is understandable for tuna in March.- 1 Tuna Toro Takumaki (JPY 720) - It was okay.As I mentioned during my first visit, the sushi rice uses red vinegar, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. While the Shime Saba didn‚Äôt impress, the other fish was better than last time, and the anago exceeded my expectations.Spending JPY 3970 for lunch is certainly not cheap, but worthwhile.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

281,I've been curious about it since I saw it on TV.,"I had been looking forward to this place ever since I saw it featured on TV's ""Gaya no Yoake,"" ""Cambria Kyden,"" and in news specials. Ordering is done via a monitor, which made it a bit challenging for me as a first-time visitor. Even though it's a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, the conveyor had no plates on it. It was surprising to find that the sushi is made and handed directly to you at the table. All the blue fish options were delicious, and while the individual dishes were tasty as well, there were a few disappointing presentations. The tamagoyaki was so poor that I had to replate it for photos. Some plates had leftover rice due to the sweetness of the sushi rice. There were items that cost nearly JPY 1000 for a single piece, so I ordered cautiously. Depending on the time of your visit, it seems you can enter without waiting. After 4:30 PM on Sundays, there were open seats available, but a line formed again after 5:00 PM. You need to come with enough time to spare, but if it means no waiting, I would love to come back. Next time, I want to try all the blue fish options along with today's specials and seasonal items. On a side note, the kanpyo was a bit lackluster in sweetness for my taste.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

284,Delicious Gourmet Sushi,"I had high expectations, which led to a bit of disappointment. The sushi was quite good, but I expected more after seeing the commercials on TV. I arrived at this kaiten sushi restaurant, Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, at 10:30 a.m. for an 11:00 opening, and I was able to issue a waiting ticket through epark. Once I got my ticket, I could wander around instead of waiting in line, which was a nice touch. Since I was about tenth in line, I got in right after they opened. Thanks to the recent TV ads, there were quite a few people waiting behind me at opening time. The interior was clean, and the chefs were energetically promoting the recommended items. The atmosphere felt lively. Interestingly, although the conveyor belt was running, there was no sushi going around; instead, orders were made via a touchscreen panel, and the chefs served freshly made sushi. Three chefs were handling a fully occupied restaurant, so the service was decent, taking a bit longer than expected but not excessively so. As for the sushi, the signature tuna was good, but I wondered if it was worth the hype. The akami was average, while the chutoro was pretty good. The quality of the fish might vary from day to day. I tried red vinegar sushi rice for the first time, and it was enjoyable without any strong flavors. We shared about 15 plates of our favorite items. None of the dishes were bad, but nothing left me feeling wowed either. However, I did enjoy the fresh sashimi from Mujoka (no unpleasant smell) and the surprise of the sprouted leeks (a delightful first-time experience). We also ordered the ara-ju, chawanmushi, and spent about JPY 10,000 for two people. Since it's gourmet sushi, I expected top-notch sushi flavors, but it felt average. Considering the speed of service, I felt the cost was a bit high. It might be reasonable when you factor in the location. I can't help but think I was overly optimistic; it's good sushi, but fairly expensive. The service was standard. If you want to enjoy quality sushi, you might find better value at a less expensive gourmet sushi place or perhaps a more upscale sushi lunch. Being able to enjoy favorite ingredients without any misses is definitely a charm. It would be nice if I could specify the sweetness of the sauce like I can with wasabi on the touch panel. The staff seemed a bit overwhelmed, as I noticed some rough edges. The sign outside still said 'Closed for Preparations' when I left, so I hope they get it all together soon!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

It is conveniently located just a one-minute walk from Omotesando Station Exit A1. I visited around 1:30 PM on a Saturday, and there were certainly many waiting customers. However, the store has a ticket-based numbering system, which allows you to wander away from the restaurant, which is quite generous. After strolling around Omotesando for about 30 minutes, I received an automated call notifying me that a seat was available, allowing me to enter.To start, I ordered based on the popular menu rankings introduced on the TV program ""Kaere Ma 10."" The price point is higher when compared to major budget sushi chains. Since they use ""Yama Ko"" Hon Maguro (real tuna), the quality certainly feels different from other revolving sushi chains. While the fish is refrigerated and therefore quite cool to the touch, you can choose the portion size of the rice, which tends to be smaller than average for revolving sushi.However, this type of restaurant can be tricky. Ordering 10 varieties of sushi and one roll along with a bowl came to about JPY 4500. It seems that to fill an adult man's appetite adequately, you would need to spend close to JPY 5000. While the ingredients are high-quality, I feel that for this price, you might as well enjoy sushi at ""Sushiro."" Alternatively, I would prefer to pay a little more and have a sushi course at ""Sushi Ginza Onodera"" (there's a JPY 5500 course). Overall, this place isn‚Äôt really family-friendly. If a child were to devour the tuna, the father's wallet would definitely take a hit!  With the rising trend of standing sushi bars, the use of this place feels a bit complicated.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

286,A generous rating for Onodera,"Dining at Onodera tends to cost around JPY 60,000 for two, so considering that, it's relatively affordable. The rating reflects the quality of their sea urchin, tuna gunkan, and fatty tuna nigiri. However, I feel that they have missed the mark on some key ingredients; the sea urchin not being enjoyable is a critical issue. For JPY 900, the taste at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant like this is quite disappointing. On the other hand, dishes like medium fatty tuna, eel, chawanmushi (savory egg custard), saba (mackerel), kinmedai (golden eye snapper), and katsuo (bonito) were quite delicious, showcasing the day's highlights.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

288,Great value for money if you visit before closing!,"On a rainy night, I had some errands nearby and thought I might be able to get in right away.I arrived around 7:30 PM and saw three people waiting in front of the restaurant.After getting a ticket from the automated system inside, there were 11 groups waiting, including those inside.I was seated in about 10 minutes at the waiting area, and around 8:00 PM, many customers began to leave.I was called shortly after and seated at the counter.The counter seating is a bit cramped, focusing on turnover, with acrylic panels placed high above.Ordering is done via a touchscreen, and tea and pickled ginger are self-service.Payments are made at the register by presenting the number card, so the system resembles that of a conveyor belt sushi restaurant.I checked the photo menu thoroughly.Nigiri sushi (2 pieces) ranges from JPY 400 to 700, while rolls start at JPY 300.I noticed that many limited items were already sold out!A large grouper (over 15 kg?) was brought in and made rounds in the restaurant.I chose three limited items that were still available, along with two others.*You can select the presence of wasabi and the size of the rice.- Grouper: JPY 720 (tax included)- Yellowtail (2 pieces): JPY 510 (tax included)- Bonito (2 pieces): JPY 510 (tax included)- Homemade marinated mackerel (2 pieces): JPY 420 (tax included)- Medium fatty tuna nakaochi gunkan (2 pieces): JPY 620 (tax included)- Yam Gobo roll: JPY 320 (tax included)The pickled ginger was pleasantly spicy, not sweet, and had a delightful Edo-style kick!Around 4-5 chefs seemed to have their own roles, bringing out sushi in no particular order.The rice is seasoned with red vinegar, resulting in soft and small nigiri that are excellent.All pieces were larger than typical while maintaining a good balance in thicknesscut well and not overly thick.Every piece was exceptionally fresh and delicious.The direct-sourced yellowtail was great, and the tuna, being a specialty here, had a rich flavor for the nakaochi as well.The marinated mackerel was fatty and delightful.As expected, I highly recommend the direct-sourced, specialty, and homemade items!Overall, the prices seemed reasonable, and I felt that every piece was of high quality.If you aim for the lower price range, the cost-performance is excellent.Given the generous portion sizes, the 9 pieces plus rolls filled me up nicely.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

289,Premium Kaiten Sushi,"I arrived around 11 AM on a holiday and received a ticket with a 30-party wait. Even though it was just after opening, there was a huge line. I finally got in around 1 PM, which is typical for the Golden Week lunch rush. I had been eagerly awaiting the conveyor belt sushi, and since it's a panel-style, I could order as much as I wanted without worrying about the line. What I ordered included fatty tuna, lean tuna, sashimi mackerel, kohada, sea bream, engawa, crab miso, scallion, toro-taku roll, shellfish cucumber roll, natto roll, and some beer...

The sushi was incredibly delicious, with a clear difference in quality compared to typical chain restaurants. Among them, there were some standout items, while others were just good. The lean sushi was decent; although the lean and fatty tuna were pricey, they didn't surpass my expectations that much. I mean, for fatty tuna, this level of taste is what I would expect. Of course, I was satisfied after eating, but... Now, let me highlight the truly impressive items I experienced: The scallion... it was refreshing with a rich, slightly bitter, and sweet flavor of green onions that filled my mouth, with a hint of plum adding to it. As for the shiny fish and white fish in general... I highly recommend these; don‚Äôt underestimate them just because they are on the cheaper side. They were deliciously thickly cut, and every bite was immensely satisfying. Especially the engawa, which was astonishingly flavorful. The natto roll... to be honest, it was shockingly delicious, almost stealing the show. I wondered, was natto ever this good? Or could the potential of natto surpass that of fish? Either way, it was such an impressive dish that I could have been content with just that alone.

294,Kaiten sushi is still the best choice...,"Today, I visited Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera located in Omotesando! I was excited to try the tuna from Yamako, which is considered the best in Japan, and to indulge in the offerings from this esteemed location.Upon entering, I found a ticket system in place, and even with the influence of TV popularity, the place was packed past 1 PM! I was one of the many waiting! I waited for about 30 to 40 minutes before being seated.Ordering was done via a touch panel for tea and sushi. The gari (pickled ginger) was perfectly balanced, not too sweet, with a hint of spiciness.First, I tried the homemade kohada (marinated shad) and shime-saba (marinated mackerel), which were alright.Next, I enjoyed the Aosa seaweed miso soup.The Yamako hon maguro akami (red tuna) was up next, along with homemade boiled shrimp that were a bit overcooked. They came plated together, which was a bit disappointing.The boiled shrimp felt a little dry, lacking the juiciness I expected.However, the akami had a refreshing taste, and the knife skills were on point, with no sinews detected.Following that, the fresh saba (mackerel) seemed a bit too soft. I wondered if it was a fatty variety.The sweet shrimp were plump, and with three pieces served, it was quite satisfying.Then, I ordered the Yamako hon maguro chutoro (medium fatty tuna)‚Ä¶ but before that plate arrived, another customer's scallion sushi was left on my plate. I discreetly moved it aside. The chutoro was cut skillfully as well, and it had a nice balance of fat with a refreshing taste.I also heard that the fried chicken was good, so I ordered it, but it turned out to be just average.The nakaochi gunkan (tuna collaterals) was rich and sweet, delicious indeed! I tried the grilled anago (sea eel) as it is also popular, but it was quite large and the small bones were quite noticeable.Finally, I ordered the Yamako hon maguro tekka maki (fatty tuna roll), which contained some sinewy parts, but it was tasty nonetheless!I considered ordering the yamako hon maguro otoro (fatty tuna), but I lost my enthusiasm.There was soy sauce on the table, but all the nigiri were already brushed with a sweetened soy sauce, so I didn‚Äôt really need it‚Ä¶ but I would have liked to hear a recommendation.The vinegared rice was made with red vinegar, which gave a touch of elegance without being overly strong. The ambiance felt very upscale!Having eaten at the main store before, I may have raised my expectations too high, leading to a bit of disappointment. The bill turned out to be quite pricey, maybe reflecting the brand value of high-end kaiten sushi?This experience made me think again about the true essence of tuna.I say this somewhat cheekily, but I really enjoyed today‚Äôs meal.

296,Popular High-End Kaiten Sushi,"This is the Kaiten Sushi version of ""Ginza Onodera"".Located in a prime spot just after turning at the intersection of Jingumae 5-chome from Omotesando, it's lined up with ""Tachi Gaki Sushi Onodera"".Upon entering the restaurant, you register your arrival using a touch panel. If you register your phone number, you will receive an automatic call when it‚Äôs your turn, whether you wait nearby or a bit further away.On a Saturday at lunchtime, there were about 10 groups waiting. I was seated in approximately 40 minutes.Although it‚Äôs called kaiten sushi, there is hardly anything revolving; only the menu signs are present. After placing orders from the touch panel, sushi plates are handed over to you directly from inside the conveyor belt area. Occasionally, sushi does come around on the belt, but hardly anyone takes it.Wouldn't it be fine without the conveyor belt?Without worrying about that, I kept ordering.Prices are for one piece for item ‚ë† and two pieces for everything else.

It had a rich layer of fat, with an amazing umami and sweetness that made me request another serving. The Yamako Chutoro was great too, but it paled in comparison to the yellowtail in terms of flavor. The price was also very reasonable, especially since it comes in two pieces.The saltwater sea urchin was understandably fresh with no unpleasant odor, and its sweetness was exceptional. I hadn't encountered a good sea urchin recently due to the rising prices, so this was a pleasant surprise.On the other hand, the conger eel was disappointing. The flesh was thick, and I had imagined it to be tender reminiscent of flan, but it had a sponge-like texture. It left me craving a drink.Other than that, everything else was delicious for the price.The total bill was around JPY 7,000 per person.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

297,"A high-end chain, yet still a kaiten sushi.","This is a new type of restaurant from the famous Sushi Ginza Onodera, known for its high cost-performance lunch. It is located across the street from the Apple Store in Omotesando.Various media outlets have featured this place, and on the day of my lunch visit, they were filming ""Kaerema‚óØn"".The appearance is just like a typical conveyor sushi restaurant, and the ordering system is through a touchscreen. However, there was nothing on the conveyor belt, which seems designed to lower the barrier for customers primarily interested in conveyor sushi.

I didn't find anything particularly memorable, including the Hon-Maguro from Yamazaki.With a counter-focused layout and a rise in efficient sushi restaurants, I couldn't find a compelling reason to specifically eat here. It left me with an impression of ""slightly refined conveyor sushi.""This place may be more appealing to those looking for something trendy rather than those wanting to try high-end sushi.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

298,A Kaiten Sushi Spot Perfect for Dates,"Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in Omotesando.This place has a luxurious interior that one wouldn't expect from a revolving sushi restaurant, making it perfect for a date!Although the decor and name might raise some eyebrows, the sushi is carefully prepared and the prices are quite reasonable.This time, I had the following:- 2 pieces of Shima Aji: JPY 420- 2 pieces of homemade Shime Saba: JPY 420- 2 pieces of live Tsubugai: JPY 840- 1 piece of premium Chutoro from Yamakatsu: JPY 620- 2 pieces of live Mirugai: JPY 620- 2 pieces of Akagai Nigiri: JPY 720- 2 pieces of Engawa: JPY 420- 1 piece of house-made Steamed Shrimp: JPY 320- 2 pieces of Shima Iwashi.I enjoyed all of this with some chilled sake.I was delighted to see a variety of my favorite shellfish.The texture was superbly crunchy as well.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

299,Highly recommend the Tuna,"This is the kaiten sushi version of the famous sushi restaurant, Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, located near the Apple Store in Omotesando.Reservations cannot be made, so it's a first-come, first-served system with ticket distribution. On a Sunday around 5:30 PM, I got in after about 30 minutes of waiting for the ticket. (I recommend arriving earlier than your desired time, as this place is very popular.)They use tuna from the well-known supplier ""Yama Ko,"" offering a variety of tuna cuts including fatty tuna (O-Toro), medium fatty tuna (Chu-Toro), lean tuna (Akami), and Toro-Taku. The O-Toro was especially rich and had a heavenly melt-in-your-mouth texture. However, the Toro-Taku seemed to have a bit less tuna than expected, which was disappointing. You can also order without rice, but I felt that having the rice enhanced the flavor of the tuna, so I would recommend ordering it with rice.While the prices are higher than typical kaiten sushi, many high-end sushi places only offer courses, which can lead to feeling full before trying everything. This place is perfect for enjoying high-quality sushi while being able to choose your preferred toppings, especially the tuna.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

300,Yamakou Hon Maguro,"On September 18 at 10:17 AM, I visited Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in Omotesando despite the rain.I ordered one piece of lean tuna and one tekka maki. The tuna from Oma was delicious, of course, but personally, I prefer the one from Toi. This is my fourth time at a kaiten sushi restaurant, so I think I'll try a standing sushi bar next.","The words representing the reviewer's impressions are:

301,Non-Conveyor Sushi,"I had been curious about this place.On my nephew's birthday, he wanted sushi, so we visited with four people. Being a rainy Friday, there were a few groups waiting around 6 PM. I thought it might take a while for a table for four, but we were promptly seated at a booth.Ordering is done via a touch panel, and the chefs prepare the sushi right there.Even though it's a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, nothing is actually rotating. I wonder what the conveyor is for? (laughs)The prices are not cheap; high-end pieces are over JPY 800 each, but there are also items starting from JPY 200 for two pieces. So, depending on what you order, it can be reasonably priced. However, if you indulge in what you want, expect to spend around JPY 7000.The sushi was delicious, and they use red vinegar for the rice, which was on the smaller sidesimilar to what you'd find in a high-end sushi restaurant.Considering that, it feels like a bargain for enjoying high-quality sushi, albeit on conveyor belt plates with clear pricing.Everything we ate was delicious, so I left feeling completely satisfied.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

I noticed a few women dining alone as well.The service was decent, though one staff member behind the counter kept repeating questions, which was a bit irritating, but still within acceptable limits.I unexpectedly had some time during lunchtime, so I decided to stop by, but I didn‚Äôt think of going for kaiten sushi in Omotesando.

It's said you can enjoy high-quality sushi at a reasonable price. I wanted to check it out, but I anticipated it would be super crowded since it's featured in the media. However, I arrived on a weekday at 4 PM and was able to get in right away.I'm thrilled to indulge in tuna from Yamako. While the nigiri is great, I particularly enjoyed the rolls. The tuna is so delicious that wrapping it with red sushi rice in crispy nori is simply perfect. The Nakaochi Gunkan Sushi was also top-notch.Ordering through the touch panel is easy, and the sushi comes out quickly. Instead of a conveyor belt, all orders are handed directly. There are plates of different sizes stacked, so it might be a bit confusing when you receive them.The interior is clean and the staff is lively. Overall, it seems like a great place!I think I had around 10 plates for about JPY 4,500. Each piece is small, so I didn't feel overly stuffed, but I was certainly satisfied with the quality.

What is Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera?Ginza Onodera, which started offering Kaiten Sushi and standing sushi in October 2021, has been frequently featured in the media.It‚Äôs known as a Michelin-star restaurant, which I thought was out of my league, but maybe as a fan of B-class gourmet, I could try their Kaiten Sushi?According to their website, it states:""From Ginza to the world.""""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, based in Ginza, Tokyo, has 12 locations across 5 regions worldwide, aiming to spread refined Japanese culture through food.""Hmm. As I researched the restaurant, it turns out that Ginza Onodera isn‚Äôt just sushi; they also offer tempura, teppanyaki, and French cuisine.[Locations of Ginza Onodera as of March 2022]- ""Sushi Ginza Onodera"" in Ginza, Shanghai, Hawaii, Los Angeles, New York- ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch"" in Omotesando- ""Standing Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch"" in Omotesando- ""Sushi Ginza Onodera Second Branch"" in Futako-Tamagawa- ""Tempura Ginza Onodera"" in Ginza, Shanghai- ""Charcoal Grilled Ginza Onodera"" in Ginza- ""Teppanyaki Ginza Onodera"" in ShanghaiThe ""Charcoal Grilled"" location is a mystery, but it seems to be a French restaurant. I also looked up some of their locations outside Japan that have been featured in the Michelin guide.[Michelin-listed locations of Ginza Onodera]- ""Charcoal Grilled Ginza Onodera"" has one star in the Michelin Guide Tokyo 2021 and 2022.- ""Sushi Ginza Onodera Los Angeles"" received two stars in the Michelin Guide California 2019.- ""Sushi Ginza Onodera New York"" has earned two stars in the Michelin Guide NYC 2018 and 2019, and one star in 2017, 2020, and 2021.That's impressive!Now, regarding ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch""; it seems to be priced relatively high for a Kaiten Sushi restaurant, but since it looks like a great blog topic, I definitely wanted to go.However, I heard the lines can be quite long, and reservations aren‚Äôt accepted for anything but private rooms. Hmm.Recently, though, I came across a review saying the lines weren't that bad. Really?Just then, I was going out to dinner with my friend O-kun, and when I mentioned wanting to go to ""Onodera,"" he seemed interested as well, and we quickly made plans.According to O-kun, ""When I tried to make a reservation at Onodera in Hawaii, I couldn‚Äôt get one."" So, it‚Äôs a sort of revenge visit for him. Wow, I didn‚Äôt even know they had a location in Hawaii until then.So, while the lines didn‚Äôt seem too severe, we agreed that the best time to go would be early on a weekday evening, and we set a meeting time for 5:30 PM.Our timing was perfect, and we didn‚Äôt wait long to be seated.The sushi we tried was exquisite, just as we hoped. I initially thought it might not be that great, but it exceeded our expectations.However, I‚Äôd suggest having a budget of at least JPY 5000.It felt like a high price for Kaiten Sushi but reasonable for high-end sushi.Even if you drink a lot and order the pricier items, it seems you would still get change from JPY 10,000.2. Appearance, menu, reservation system, and atmosphere of Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in OmotesandoIt's been a while since I visited Omotesando.Near Omotesando IntersectionI usually walk from Harajuku or Shibuya, but I suddenly wanted to arrive a bit earlier, so I took the subway.The ""Kaiten Sushi Onodera"" is located a little further down from Omotesando Intersection, where you walk towards Harajuku and turn left.The exterior of Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch (first view)Good news, there‚Äôs no line.The entrance on the right is for ""Standing Sushi Onodera.""The exterior of Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch (second view)I wasn't sure if that one was open. But since we aimed for the Kaiten Sushi, I only took a quick glance before heading inside.They also have a takeout menu. The Bara Chirashi looks incredibly delicious, but it‚Äôs JPY 3,240.Inside, there‚Äôs a machine for accepting numbers and issuing tickets.I grabbed ticket number 19 and sat down in the waiting area.This is where I met O-kun.From this angle, the atmosphere of the restaurant looks like this.The front has a U-shaped counter where several sushi chefs are working. Similar setups can be seen in my favorite active sushi spots.After a moment, we were guided to our seats.The place felt quite upscale.As time passed, I noticed the lighting was just perfect for taking photos. It seems they‚Äôve carefully considered that customers would post on social media.The wall displayed the recommended dishes of the day:The recommended daily menu posted inside Kaiten Sushi Ginza OnoderaBasic orders were made via a touch panel.It was the familiar system that‚Äôs seen at popular places like Sushiro and Kura Sushi, but O-kun was amazed saying he had never seen it before since he typically doesn‚Äôt eat at Kaiten Sushi.I realized again how different our life paths have been since our student days. (laugh)Now, as I looked at the touch panel, I was shocked at what I saw.This homemade marinated mackerel kombu roll. I was planning to order it since it looks so Instagrammable, but sadly, it was already sold out. Sweat.Also, there was a much-coveted fish called ""Kue"".Though it looks grotesque, it‚Äôs currently waiting for stock.And finally, simmered anago (conger eel).I definitely meant to order this, but I realized I forgot to eat it.2. What I had at Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera in Omotesando2.1 Sushi and appetizersThe bill was separated, and we ordered separately. However, the drinks bill was handwritten and combined for two people.The photos I‚Äôll post here primarily focus on what I ordered, but I‚Äôve included some dishes where I just took a quick picture.To start, the ankimo (monkfish liver) was quite a surprise.Ankimo @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoThey clearly used fresh and high-quality ingredients. This might have been the best ankimo I‚Äôve ever had. The texture was superb, and the delicately light seasoning was perfect.Next, we had shrimp fried whole in the shell.Whole shrimp fried in the shell @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoThe combination of seaweed salt and lemon was perfect. I enjoyed them crispy, right down to the shells.And then there was the mackerel.Mackerel @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoAs an oil-loving person, I always order this at sushi places, and it was fantastic. The melt-in-your-mouth texture was the best. The rice was red rice that had a mix of red vinegar. The portion size of the sushi was also more than adequate.Next were the two dishes O-kun had: shime saba (marinated mackerel) and maaji (jack mackerel).Homemade shime saba @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoMaaji @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoMeanwhile, I ordered the rich salmon belly.Rich salmon belly @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoSalmon is generally delicious, but this one was rich, and both the fatty part and the lean part were tasty.Finally, I ordered three pieces of ""Yamaco Hon Maguro"". I was determined to try this.First, the tekka maki (tuna rolls).Yamaco Hon Maguro tekka hosomaki @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoThe tuna was a bit larger with a golden ratio, making it delicious. Though there were some tough parts, when bitten, it brought out the flavors. This was classic good tuna.Next was the chutoro (medium fatty tuna).Yamaco Hon Maguro chutoro @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoThis was the one item that didn‚Äôt impress me much that day. It wasn‚Äôt overly fatty. The appearance was even more red than expected.But the final piece, the otoro (fatty tuna), was an artistic vision of marbling.Yamaco Hon Maguro otoro @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch in OmotesandoIt was incredibly tender and delicious. By the way, the chutoro is JPY 620 per piece, and the otoro is JPY 930.3.2 DrinksFor drinks, we had two beers and one glass each of white and red wine.Premium Malts (medium) and Premium Malts (glass).Initially, I thought the glass might be too small, so I ordered the medium, but even that wasn‚Äôt a lot. I had the glass at the end.The wine was ""Payrelle Reserve."" The white was ""Payrelle Reserve Sauvignon Blanc"" from the Languedoc region of France, and the red was ""Payrelle Reserve Pinot Noir"" also from the Languedoc region of France.The Sauvignon Blanc had a noble flavor reminiscent of Chardonnay, and it was delicious.The Pinot Noir didn‚Äôt have as much body as I expected. I regretted that it was chilled, as it's one of those things that is usually best served at room temperature in sushi restaurants.The total bill was around JPY 13,000. O-kun ended up paying a bit more because he ordered more.Overall, it was highly satisfactory and reasonable, although I wouldn‚Äôt say they had an exceptionally skilled team of sushi chefs.4.

305,"Delicious, but probably won't return. The target audience is somewhat unclear.","I stopped by around noon on the weekend and there was a wait of 27 parties! So I decided to come back on a Monday around 4:30 PM. There was no wait at all, and the restaurant was about half full.The sushi wasn't on a conveyor belt; instead, it was ordered via a touch panel. What stood out to me were the engawa (flounder fin) and the shime saba (vinegared mackerel) wrapped in kombu. I'm not usually a fan of engawa, but it was really delicious! The horse mackerel was thick, but it was just okay. The uni (sea urchin) was small, one bite size, but there was too much sushi rice compared to the uni, making it hard to taste.We tried various items like shrimp, amaebi (sweet shrimp), tuna, squid, and sardine. Four of us had a total of 36 plates for JPY 17,700.While it was tasty for a conveyor belt sushi place, those with money looking for something special would probably choose a high-end restaurant, especially when there are so many affordable sushi spots that are quite delicious. I didn't quite understand the target demographic. There might be many first-time visitors just giving it a try, but I doubt it will attract many repeat customers.The staff were friendly and energetic, but it came off as a bit cheap in feel.

I was prepared for a wait, but perhaps because it was a weekday, I was able to get in smoothly!I was seated at the counter and ordered through the touch panel in front of me. As expected given the Onodera name, the prices are significantly different from those at regular chain conveyor belt sushi restaurants (laughs). With high expectations, I ordered a comparison of head-on shrimp, kinmedai (golden eye snapper), sea urchin, sardines, horse mackerel, medium fatty tuna from Yamazaki, squid, tekka maki (tuna rolls), and of course, anago (grilled eel) at the end! I made sure not to forget the miso soup with fish scraps.Today's miso soup was made with salmon scraps and was hearty with large pieces of salmon. The restaurant was about 80% full, but I wasn‚Äôt kept waiting too long, and the dishes came out smoothly. Although it's a conveyor belt sushi place, the sushi is primarily prepared by the chefs who serve it directly to you right after making it.I took a few photos, but honestly, there wasn‚Äôt anything that particularly impressed me. Perhaps I had too high of expectations, especially considering the price in this area, which isn‚Äôt low, and for that price, the quality of the sushi didn't seem to match. I ordered a lot, so I left full, but I didn‚Äôt feel very satisfiedwhat a disappointment.

312,Kaiten Sushi at Ginza Onodera,"We decided to have a sushi lunch, and chose to visit Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera, which I had been wanting to try for a while. It opens at 11 AM, and even though we arrived a bit late, we got in without any issues. It started to get crowded right after us, so we were lucky! (laughs) Though it's a conveyor belt sushi place, the sushi isn't sitting out; instead, they bring it to you once you order! The comparison between the Nodoguro (blackthroat sea perch) and uni (sea urchin) was delicious! The medium-fatty tuna ( chutoro) was also tasty. It was inexpensive, so I might go back again! ^_^","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

313,Kaiten Sushi by Onodera Group,"While searching for places on Tabelog, I came across a restaurant with delicious-looking red vinegar sushi, and it turned out to be part of the Onodera Group. When you think of the Onodera Group, you think of their incredible track record, including being the top bidder for the first tuna auction in Toyosu, earning Michelin stars, and being recognized as one of Tabelog's top sushi restaurants in Tokyo. I had to go! ^_^After work in the city, I visited for dinner. I parked my car at a nearby coin parking lot and arrived at 6:50 PM with a companion. It was crowded, but we were able to enter without waiting, though customers arriving after us had to wait. This place is quite popular.We sat at the counter and placed our orders via the touch panel. Although it's called Kaiten Sushi, the sushi wasn‚Äôt actually rotating on the conveyer belt! (laughs)**Order:**Two pieces of medium fatty bluefin tuna, Yama Kou‚Äôs lean bluefin tuna, homemade simmered anago (sea eel), snow crab, genuine squid, whole head botan shrimp, lightly grilled engawa, grilled nodoguro (black throat sea perch), today‚Äôs select sea urchin small bowl, Yama Kou‚Äôs fatty bluefin tuna maki, and Aosa seaweed soup from Ise-Shima.The quality here is definitely not what you‚Äôd expect from a conveyor belt sushi restaurant. In fact, there‚Äôs no sushi actually rotating! I love the red vinegar rice. The Yama Kou bluefin tuna and homemade simmered anago were both delightful.We enjoyed a lot, and the total came to JPY 7,000, tax included, for one person. I definitely want to come back! It was a great meal.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

314,Kaiten Sushi at Ginza Onodera,"I visited the Kaiten Sushi branch of the ""Ginza Onodera Group,"" which opened in Omotesando last autumn.I arrived around 11:05, shortly after the weekend opening, and there were a few seats available. We were quickly seated, but soon after, more customers came in and it became fully booked.The interior is bright and flashy, but it doesn't feel particularly high-end.By the way, the sushi doesn‚Äôt revolve; instead, you order via a touch panel system.We toasted with a ""draft beer"" and started with ""fried squid legs"". We then ordered a variety of fish, starting with ""cold gray mullet,"" ""natural sea bream,"" and ""stone bream,"" followed by ""Yamako Hon Maguro Akami,"" ""purple sea urchin,"" "" bafun sea urchin,"" ""seared salmon,"" ""homemade simmered conger eel,"" ""red sea bream,"" and ""live yellowtail,"" along with ""Aosa seaweed soup from Ise-Shima.""In terms of taste, the sushi's quality, from the toppings to the skill of the chef, feels like it's positioned between high-end sushi and local sushi shops, which is reflected in the pricing.In other words, while it isn't top-tier sushi, its quality and offerings stand out from cheap conveyor-belt sushi and neighborhood sushi establishments.

While it might be on the pricier side for a kaiten sushi restaurant, considering it's in Ginza, I believe it‚Äôs perfect for families. You can enjoy your meal casually and take as much as you want. I really enjoy kaiten sushi! The castella-style egg and the freshly made tamagoyaki from the skilled chefs were truly delicious. The anago (conger eel) was expertly prepared, and the rolls made with saba (mackerel) were incredibly tasty. Is the tuna from Yamazukuri? Everything had high quality, the restaurant was new and spotless, and it even seems like you can make reservations despite it being a kaiten sushi place.

The medium fatty tuna was also good.Although the food came out quickly, I was disappointed to find soy sauce splattered on the plates. It's nice that they apply it for you...I do like warm sushi rice, but the pieces were made too loosely, making it difficult to pick up the anago (sea eel), and I ended up leaving a lot of rice on the plate.The sloppy presentation really reminded me that it‚Äôs still a kaiten sushi place.While I don't intend to compare it with non-rotating sushi restaurants, the lack of attention to detail compared to other kaiten sushi places stood out.Given my expectations, I was quite disappointed.It was a great meal.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

Naturally, we did, and it was delicious.While the sushi is tasty, the variety of toppings is somewhat limited.The sushi is made without using seasoned soy sauce, so the rice has a nice flavor on its own.Most pieces are around JPY 400 each.The most expensive was the uni (sea urchin) at JPY 800, I believe.Reservations are not accepted.There is a ticket machine in front of the restaurant where you check in.I was told it would be a one-hour wait, but it was actually about 30 minutes.There are lanes, but they weren't busy at all.The restaurant is spacious and very clean.Despite its size, there are few seats, making it feel quite comfortable.Expect your budget to be around JPY 5000 to JPY 7000 per person.Given this, it's a great way to enjoy the atmosphere of a high-end establishment.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

And it's incredibly delicious!! - Kohada (gizzard shad) The rice is seasoned with red vinegar, which complements the house-made marinated kohada perfectly. I had to get a second serving! - Natto Maki (fermented soybean roll) You can choose from three toppings to go on top, and I picked all of them. The plum was delicious! Surprisingly, they also have bottle and glass wines available. They even have Lamone's Monrachet on the menu! As expected from a top sushi restaurant in Ginza, the quality holds up even in a conveyor belt setting. For now, I enjoyed a glass of wine, which was chilled to perfection. And of course, I had tuna from Yamazaki. Hmm, maybe it's better to eat it in Ginza after all. So I ordered some fries! They weren't seasoned with salt, but they tasted great with a bit of soy sauce.

330,The character for food means to improve people; it signifies their betterment. @ Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,"""The conveyor has stopped, haha, at Kaiten Sushi Onodera""In recent years, the Onodera Group has gained a reputation by collaborating with Yamatsuki to procure the first tuna of the new year (Ichiban Maguro). This location combines Kaiten (conveyor belt) sushi and standing sushi bar in one place, which is situated in Omotesando. While strolling down Omotesando, I suddenly remembered and decided to visit for the first time since its opening.Despite being just before dinner peak time, there were already more than ten groups of foreigners waiting, haha. Still, I was able to enter relatively smoothly.„ÄêAtmosphere of the restaurant„ÄëAs usual, it gives off a ""luxurious"" rather than ""high-end"" vibe, and it seems to cater to foreign customers, haha. After being seated, I was surprised to find that the familiar conveyor belt was not operating. Upon inquiring, I learned that they had changed from the conveyor belt system to a more traditional plate service style. The concept has shifted, haha...While such a comment may seem unnecessary, it seems like it turned out fine, haha. The reason for this change is that about 70% of the customers are foreigners, and it was also considered from a hygiene standpoint.„ÄêOrder details at Kaiten Sushi Onodera„ÄÅEFlatfish (JPY 350). ‚óÅESquid (JPY 300). ‚óÅEYamatsuki Hon Maguro Assorted (Otoro, Chutoro, Akami) (JPY 2000). ‚óÅEPurple Sea Urchin (JPY 1100). ‚óÅESprout Negi (JPY 210). ‚óÅEAosa Seaweed Soup from Ise-Shima (JPY 350). ‚ñ≥ Kanpyo Hosomaki (JPY 370). ‚ñ≥ Homemade Castella Egg (JPY 320). ‚óã„ÄêFood impressions„ÄëThe ""Tekka Maki"" I ordered was sold out,In the end, my total came to around JPY 5000, and considering the content, I think it was a good price. In terms of the sushi's quality, I believe it rivals the recently popular high-end standing sushi bars that charge between JPY 7000 and JPY 10000, thanks to their strong procurement power. However, since there are many customers, the execution was a bit messy. For example... while the red vinegar rice was on the smaller side, the cuts of fish varied significantly.If they could ensure a more uniform size and thickness, it would improve the overall experience.Additionally, the kanpyo was quite bland, and yet the wasabi‚Äôs sharpness was overwhelmingly strong, so it might be better to change the wasabi.„ÄêService„ÄëThere was a new entertainment element introduced, where staff enthusiastically shout encouragement when serving drinks and dishes, which seems aimed at foreign customers.

Though it‚Äôs kaiten sushi, it wasn‚Äôt rotating at that time, meaning we got freshly made sushi right after ordering.The cost performance is somewhat lacking, coming to around JPY 6,000 per person. For that price, there are lunch course options available at other places.Still, I could feel the commitment to quality, especially with the use of Yama Ko's bluefin tuna and the high level of the ingredients.It was a great meal.

I wanted to visit as soon as possible, but since it is a Michelin-starred restaurant offering sushi at kaiten sushi prices, many customers have been flooding in.Thinking the initial rush might have calmed down, I visited after running some errands around 14:30. To my surprise, I was able to enter without waiting, and since it was a quieter time, we were allowed to use a table even though there were just two of us.The stylish interior, without being overly flashy, exudes an air of elegance, and the spacious layout allows for a relaxed dining experience.During my visit, I was served 'Kanpachi', which was just filleted, and 'Katsu Jime Tai' as advertised on the conveyor belt. I savored the deliciousness of the firm white fish.Next up was 'Mujoka Namazaba', a brand of mackerel farmed in Kagoshima. Because its feed is carefully managed, there is little concern for the parasite Anisakis. Not long ago, this 'Namazaba' could only be enjoyed in Kyushu, but now you can savor the sweet freshness of live mackerel right in the city.Then came the tuna. I was delighted to find that I could enjoy premium fatty tuna from 'Yama Ko', which won the top bid for tuna at the first auction of the year at Toyosu Market, all at a reasonable price. I enjoyed the rich flavor and umami of the red meat and the melt-in-your-mouth texture of the medium fatty tuna.The steamed shrimp provided a satisfying texture and flavor, and the large scallops were sweet and delicious.However, my excitement was slightly dampened when I realized that the snow crab was not served 'live' as I had naively expected.I also enjoyed a total of 11 pieces of sushi, including salmon, kohada, and live turban shell, along with a soup. Since I was already full, I completely forgot to order the simmered eel. I was very satisfied with the bill, which came to just under JPY 4,000.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

336,"Enjoying plenty of ""Taito"" Japanese Sake served in a masu, along with fresh tuna from Yamakou","On this day, I visited 'Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera' located in Omotesando.This esteemed sushi restaurant, which has been awarded a Michelin star, opened its kaiten sushi and standing sushi bar in October 2021.When I arrived around 11:20 AM on Saturday, I was informed that there was about a 30-minute wait for the sit-down sushi. Meanwhile, there was no line for the standing sushi, but I decided to wait inside for a seat.In fact, I was seated at the counter in about 20 minutes.The restaurant is clean and spacious, creating a pleasant sense of openness. Although the sushi conveyor belt is operating, sushi does not flow on it. Instead, you can place orders using a touch panel, and the chef prepares the sushi and hands you the plate directly.For sake, they offer Dassai, and for shochu, they have Mori Izo. After some thought, I decided to go for the recommended sake, 'Taiho'.Soon after, a chef brought a large bottle and filled my glassserved generously to the brim of the masu (sake cup)with his enthusiastic greeting.

337,"High-end Michelin-starred Kaiten Sushi featuring exquisite ""Yamakou Hon Maguro"" and reasonably priced ""Kids Sushi""","The ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch"" opened on October 8 in Omotesando.This is a new concept of ""Ginza Onodera,"" which has received Michelin stars for its sushi and French cuisine both domestically and internationally.Located just off Omotesando, it's a 1-2 minute walk from Exit A1 of Omotesando Station.The right side features the ""Tachikui Sushi Ginza Onodera Main Branch,"" while the left side is dedicated to the ""Kaiten Sushi"" area.The interior seems to only have counter seating, spacious and luxurious with plenty of staff.It has a feeling of luxury, yet the staff's energetic demeanor gives it a pleasantly casual vibe typical of a kaiten sushi place.Although it‚Äôs a kaiten sushi, the sushi doesn‚Äôt move on a conveyor belt; instead, it‚Äôs freshly prepared and handed over as ordered via a touchscreen panel.The plates are also used for billing, which gives it a kaiten sushi feel.The menu is quite extensive, featuring assorted nigiri, rolls, and side dishes, with sushi starting from the 200 JPY range, but most options seem to be in the 300 to 500 JPY range.The drink selection is impressive for a kaiten sushi, with a variety of beers, highballs, Japanese sake, shochu, and wine.They only serve draft beer, but the lineup of options like Isojimanjyu, Mori Izo, and champagne is sure to please any beverage enthusiast.Among the many toppings, the most notable is the ""Hon Maguro"" from the tuna dealer ""Yamakou.""They offer 4 kinds: otoro (fatty tuna), chutoro (medium fatty tuna), akami (red meat), and marinated tuna, available from a single piece.""Yamakou Hon Maguro Akami, 1 piece"" - 320 JPYYou can choose the portion of rice from the touchscreen, so I selected a smaller amount.The beautiful red meat clearly stands out in quality.Upon tasting, it was moist, finely textured, and silky.It felt a bit aged, and the slight chewiness was irresistible.""Yamakou Hon Maguro Akami Zuke, 1 piece"" - 420 JPYThis version had an increased stickiness and deeper umami flavor.Like the akami, it was also thickly sliced, providing a full-bodied experience, and the slightly stronger red vinegar rice was excellent.""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera 3 Piece Assortment (Kinmedai, Natural Buri, Hirame)"" - 930 JPYThis weekend-only menu features larger pieces for all toppings.The chewy hirame, kinmedai, and richly fatty natural buri were all satisfying.""Live Hokkigai, 2 pieces"" - 510 JPYThis consisted of 2 pieces, including the body and strip, which were a bit smaller.While they had some sweetness and weren't bad, they felt average compared to the tuna and white fish.""Yamakou Hon Maguro Chutoro, 1 piece"" - 510 JPYAnother stunning piece of tuna.The deliciousness of the fat melting on the tongue was remarkable.""Kids Sushi"" - 720 JPYUnlike high-end sushi restaurants, it‚Äôs evident that they are targeting family customers with this menu.This includes half-size sushi of tuna, shrimp, and salmon in 6 pieces, along with fried chicken, French fries, and 2 cakes, providing excellent value.Even the kids' sushi includes tuna from Yamakou (this place only uses Yamakou tuna).The salmon with ikura and the cakes were reportedly delicious, and the freshly fried chicken served as a great snack.Since this is a Michelin-starred restaurant in a kaiten sushi format, I noticed mixed reactions during its early days.From my experience, the preparation didn't reach the level of high-end sushi; perhaps the slightly elevated price as a kaiten sushi was a point of contention.I approached it with an understanding of the prices and ambiance after reading various opinions, so I enjoyed it just fine as a kaiten sushi.However, even with the touchscreen ordering system, I had to remind them twice for one of my orders, so that aspect could definitely be improved.Additionally, it‚Äôs certainly on the pricier side compared to other gourmet kaiten sushi places, and ordering too freely can lead to unexpectedly high bills.However, considering the location in upscale Omotesando, many might want to enjoy delicious sushi even at a higher price.Personally, I think ordering something like the ""Dassai"" for around 1230 JPY and sampling some quality toppings would be ideal.While there may be variations in quality among the items, the ""Yamakou Hon Maguro"" is a luxurious treat even kids can appreciate.I can only say it's fantastic to be able to enjoy this tuna with childrenit‚Äôs definitely a must-try!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

338,Stylish Kaiten Sushi in Omotesando,"On a Saturday night in Omotesando, I visited a stylish new kaiten sushi restaurant. Since reservations aren‚Äôt available, I headed straight to the restaurant and was pleased to be seated without a wait. The interior was bright and exuded a sense of luxury. For drinks, I chose Aitakuno Matsuyama sake from Miyagi. Ordering was done through a touchscreen. I started with premium tuna belly, followed by engawa (fluke fin), fresh aomori clams, sweet shrimp, konbu kelp with roe, steamed shrimp, and fresh mackerel.The gunkan series included gunkan with crab miso, boiled shirasu (young sardine), shiro-uo (white fish), and crab-flavored salad gunkan. Each ingredient had its origin written, making selection enjoyable. My companions ordered their favorite nigiri, along with a torotaku (fatty tuna and takuan radish) roll and chawanmushi with snow crab and salmon roe. To finish, we also tried the house-made castella egg and crme brle. The rice is relatively small, so we kept eating more. For two people enjoying our preferred selections, we each spent about JPY 5000.

However, it seemed there were a few staff members, making things feel a bit hectic.They also offer a kids' set, which is quite a deal, priced at around JPY 700.

It had a relatively light flavor, which is understandable for tuna in March.- 1 Tuna Toro Takumaki (JPY 720) - It was okay.As I mentioned during my first visit, the sushi rice uses red vinegar, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. While the Shime Saba didn‚Äôt impress, the other fish was better than last time, and the anago exceeded my expectations.Spending JPY 3970 for lunch is certainly not cheap, but worthwhile.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

344,Visited for 2 consecutive weeks since opening,"On the Grand Opening day, I visited around 7 PM after work. I told my name to the cashier and receptionist, and when I asked about the waiting time, it was approximately 45 minutes. I anticipated an early closing due to running out of ingredients, but the wait was surprisingly short. Plus, there was an empty spot in the waiting area. Most groups were two or more people, making me, as a solo diner, feel a bit outnumbered. To my surprise, there were few congratulatory flowers from celebrities, with more names related to business. They invited media representatives for a pre-opening and opened boldly with glowing online reviews as their weapon.The highlight of the opening was the premium tuna from Toyosu Nakauchi Yamakou, with prices for the different cuts listed as follows: Otoro (fatty tuna) for 720  420, Chutoro (medium fatty tuna) for 510  280, and Akami (red meat) for 320  210.Even for a conveyor belt sushi, these prices were reasonable for the quality that typically isn't easily accessible. I tried red rice for the first time and found it to be more aromatic compared to regular white rice. I enjoyed two pieces each of otoro, chutoro, and akami in that order, and each was delicious. The otoro was rich with sweet fat yet had a firm texture and distinctive flavor.Moreover, the tuna pieces were artistically sliced on the surface to enhance the flavor, showcasing the craftsmanship worthy of Michelin recognition. Afterwards, I had two more pieces of otoro, marinated akami, two pieces of nakaochi gunkan, a roll with torutaku (tuna and mountain yam), and finished with homemade castella-style egg. Everything was satisfying in taste. I wonder if they can keep these prices for longer than the advertised three-day campaign.The draft beer at 750 is on the expensive side.I plan to visit a standing sushi bar tomorrow.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

345,"Expensive for a conveyor belt sushi, but perhaps a bargain for Onodera's sushi...","‚Äª This is a critical review.I heard that there's a wait, so I arrived just after 10 AM on a weekday. There were two groups ahead of me, and by the time it was past 11 AM, the line had grown quite a bit.They opened at 11:30, and I was able to get in on the first round without any trouble! There were plenty of seats at the counter and in booths, and everyone who had lined up before opening managed to get in during the first round.Since it was the grand opening, I received a brief explanation about that and then ordered my favorite sushi using the touch panel.After the first piece arrived, I waited quite a while for the next sushi to come (laughs). I had to wait about 10 minutes for the next piece. Even though my order was in, I sometimes received items I hadn't ordered or things I had ordered arrived much later...Well, considering it's a brand new opening, it's understandable that the operation isn't running smoothly...That said, there were way too few chefs for the number of seats! Yet everyone seemed relaxed and was chatting, which concerned me quite a bit!As for the sushi itself, there were delicious pieces like the shrimp, shellfish, and shima-aji, but there were also some that made me go, 'hmm'especially the tuna, which seemed clearly frozen.

346,Kaiten Sushi in Omotesando! Beautiful interior!,"I heard that the famous Michelin-starred ""Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera"" has started offering conveyor belt sushi in Omotesando!Oh no?! It's showing fully booked today!! Wait, what a shock... But then I found out it was the ""Standing Sushi Ginza Onodera"" that was fully booked! What a relief! Haha.Upon entering, the interior is spacious and gorgeous!I'm so happy that I can choose the smaller rice portion!The selected uni from the special uni bowl was delicious with no unpleasant odor! Amazing!!I ended up ordering two of them! The mackerel was also fresh!!The only disappointment was the fatty tuna. It had a bit of a chewy texture. My friend shared the same opinion.The cooked fish soup was consistently delicious! The crab and salmon roe chawanmushi along with the squid tentacles were superb!!I felt a slight odor in the sea snail, so even though I love shellfish, I decided to stick to just one plate this time!The homemade marinated mackerel wrapped in kombu was flavorful! The price range is a bit on the high end, typical of high-class conveyor belt sushi!Given the location, maybe that's perfectly fine! The freshness is outstanding!And the portions are generous!There weren‚Äôt any sushi on the conveyor belt.I couldn't help but think it was a waste not to use the conveyor to display the sushi!

347,Eat for free or pay to eat?,"I wonder if it's really worth paying for this myself. It seems like it's fine for those who get invited to promote it. The tuna is delicious, but there are quite a few questionable items on the menu, and a lot of frozen fish as well. If you're excited to experience high-end kaiten sushi in Ginza, you might be disappointed. The offerings lean towards what you'd typically find at a kaiten sushi restaurant, including the menu items. Using red vinegar might give it an air of uniqueness, but it mostly caters to general tastes without much flavor distinction. I think for a kaiten sushi place, that's acceptable. However, if they're promoting their homemade kohada or anago, they could do better, as the anago had a strong fishy smell. The small tuna rolls didn't have enough filling, and the way the shrimp was steamed was puzzling. When you think of kaiten sushi, you usually think of salad gunkanmaki, and honestly, this place couldn't compete with bigger chains. The tuna was the standout, and while shellfish and other types of sushi were fine, it's only expected considering the prices. To be honest, if I'm paying this price, I'd rather have sushi from Sushiro. I actually think Sushiro is amazing. Good tuna makes you feel like you spent a lot when you eat it this way. If it‚Äôs the same price, I'd prefer standing sushi places like Akira or similar ones that provide better quality, even if they don‚Äôt have a conveyor belt.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

348,Kaiten Sushi Onodera is now open! Discover what sets it apart from traditional conveyor belt sushi and what remains the same...,"Located near the Omotesando Crossing, on the opposite side of the street from Ito Hospital, you'll find Onodera's new concept featuring Kaiten Sushi and standing sushi. I decided to try the Kaiten Sushi.It was busy, though I‚Äôm unsure if it was just due to the opening. I arrived right at the opening time, so I ended up waiting for the second rotation. After signing my name, I was told it would take an hour, so I stepped away for a bit. I returned an hour later, waited a little, and was seated around 12:30.As for the sushi, I ordered using the touch panels, as is typical for conveyor belt sushi. I‚Äôd like to comment on the operation first: The touch panel response was poor, and there were quite a few items marked as sold out or not ready, even during lunch hours. The staff seemed inexperienced, as I almost received multiple orders of the same items, and some took a long time to arrive. There was also an announcement after the bill inviting patrons to try items not listed on the menu, which I wish had been mentioned earlier.In terms of operation, there are certainly more refined practices in established conveyor belt sushi places, and it seems they're still getting used to the concept. I look forward to their improvement in the future. However, all the staff were cheerful and showed great customer service, sometimes joking around, which created a vibrant and pleasant atmosphere.Now, regarding the sushi itself, it was decent. But I couldn‚Äôt help but think the price was only justified in Omotesando or maybe overseas. The tuna from Yamayuki, served in various cuts like akami, chutoro, and otoro, as well as warship sushi, are quite good quality and not something you‚Äôd typically find in conveyor belt sushi, but the prices have completely surpassed the norm for kaiten sushi (though today, during their opening sale, Yamayuki's tuna was half price).The cuts and rice were somewhat typical of conveyor belt sushi, with a noticeable roughness and dryness. The rice was large and combined with juicy toppings, making for a somewhat overwhelming experience. On the bright side, the beer was perfect and worth the price! The wine selection was also impressive, carefully chosen to pair well with the sushi. Japanese sake and shochu (including Moriizu!) were also available, which could appeal to international patrons.Next, I‚Äôd like to try the standing sushi.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

They have a waiting list system which gives you an estimated return time, so you can relax in the meantime.I heard that there used to be a caf in this location, also managed by the Onodera Group, but the space is incredibly spacious.The lighting and decor are beautiful, making it hard to believe it‚Äôs a conveyor belt sushi restaurant.The bright interior is welcoming, even for solo female diners.You can order your preferred items using the touch panel in front of you. You can also select the size of the rice and whether or not you want wasabi.I eagerly awaited the sushi, starting with Yamazuki's premium bluefin tuna: akami, chutoro, and otoro.Notably, the sushi rice is made with red vinegar, which is a first for me at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant.The cutting is a bit rough at times, but the quality of the ingredients shines through, making it very delicious. The level of fat in the fish is fantastic.The sea urchin, which has been increasing in price this year, arrived in a beautiful dish and was delightfully rich and sweet!While the prices for each item are on the higher side for conveyor belt sushi, they are quite satisfying overall.I wonder how many regulars they will attract at this price point, given the location.Next time, I would like to stop by solo for a casual visit.Instagram: lunchkirakira (Ginza Lunch)https://www.instagram.com/lunchkirakira/?hl=jaI just surpassed 19,000 followers!","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

350,A New Concept at Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,"I visited on the second day of the grand opening. It was just after opening, but they had run out of kohada (young sardine), scallops, and turban shell, which was a bit disappointing. While the quality of the ingredients was generally good, I felt that the price did not match the value of items like flounder, chu-toro (medium fatty tuna), o-toro (fatty tuna), and botan shrimp. With the new format in place, I understand that there will be some initial hiccups during the opening.Perhaps things will smooth out after a month.

Although it's labeled as a conveyor-belt sushi restaurant, you can order via a touch panel and the sushi will be prepared right in front of you. The touch panel allows you to choose the size of the rice and even opt for no wasabi, making it very accommodating for women and families. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is lively and enjoyable! Both the rice and the toppings are incredibly deliciousfar beyond what you'd expect from a conveyor-belt sushi restaurant!

Naturally, we did, and it was delicious.While the sushi is tasty, the variety of toppings is somewhat limited.The sushi is made without using seasoned soy sauce, so the rice has a nice flavor on its own.Most pieces are around JPY 400 each.The most expensive was the uni (sea urchin) at JPY 800, I believe.Reservations are not accepted.There is a ticket machine in front of the restaurant where you check in.I was told it would be a one-hour wait, but it was actually about 30 minutes.There are lanes, but they weren't busy at all.The restaurant is spacious and very clean.Despite its size, there are few seats, making it feel quite comfortable.Expect your budget to be around JPY 5000 to JPY 7000 per person.Given this, it's a great way to enjoy the atmosphere of a high-end establishment.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

The opening was delayed by over 20 minutes, but the atmosphere inside was lively and pleasant. Of course, there were reporters asking if they could take pictures of us while we ate, which was a no-go, but I ended up on TV when they showed the overall scene.

355,A conveyor sushi restaurant with high-quality ingredients,"On a Saturday afternoon, I visited using the EPARK reservation system. It's a well-designed system, but predicting the wait time is difficult as the number of waiting parties can suddenly decrease or not decrease at all. This is something to accept.The staff and chefs provided excellent service, leaving a good impression. There were many chefs, and I didn't have to wait long for my orders, which was also a positive experience.The sushi toppings were great, as expected from a high-end chain, and there was no comparison to regular conveyor belt sushi. However, the skill levels of the chefs varied. Some seemed to be inexperienced while others were seasoned and skilled. Overall, the sushi was prepared with a sense of urgency, and few chefs took their time to craft each piece.Since I was drinking, I switched from sushi to sashimi for my order midway through. By the way, ordering sashimi is possible through the tablet system, which is very convenient.I ordered tempura with squid, but it was quite disappointing. It was more like fried food rather than tempura. I‚Äôd say the tempura at Kurazushi is better. It‚Äôs disheartening that a high-end restaurant would serve tempura that is worse than what a machine can produce. What a shame!The salad was delicious, with no issues at all.My total came to just over JPY 8000 for some drinks and food. However, considering the expensive area of Omotesando, the cost-performance isn‚Äôt particularly concerning; given the quality of the sushi, it seems reasonable. I was just shocked by how terrible the tempura was. Unless something changes significantly, I don't think I will return. I might reconsider if there‚Äôs zero wait time.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

It was a bit disappointing that there was often no nigiri sushi available, but thinking about it, I suppose I can't really complain since it's kaiten sushi. They use high-quality tuna. Our total was JPY 8,000 for two. The highlights were the tuna and the trout (though only on the first piece).

As for the fatty tuna, it's a solid choice if you're a fan.As for the flying fish, snapper, grouper, bonito, and gizzard shad, it seems it might depend on the chef; the sushi made by the person who prepared these was rather underwhelming.

365,Had high expectations for Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera,"I visited the Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera group, known for earning a Michelin star within a year of opening in NY, with high expectations. I heard they don‚Äôt take reservations, so I arrived at 6 PM on a weekday, expecting to wait. To my surprise, I was seated immediately. For the record, by around 7 PM, the restaurant was fully booked.The entrance exudes luxury, but once inside, while the decor looks lavish in photos, it feels pretty ordinary for a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, although it is clean.As is typical for conveyor belt sushi places, there‚Äôs a lively shout of ""We‚Äôve got a new order!"" when food is delivered, which brings a good atmosphere. However, considering it‚Äôs a high-end establishment and its location in Harajuku, perceptions may vary.Now, for the taste: While it‚Äôs certainly different from 100 yen conveyor belt sushi, I was disappointed because I expected to enjoy high-quality sushi from ""Ginza Onodera"" in a more affordable format.I tried the renowned Yamakou tuna, eating both the lean and chu-toro cuts. They were at a level that could be found at a sushi shop offering a 10,000 JPY omakase or 3,800 JPY for 10 pieces. I wondered if perhaps they had a bad shipment that day, as they didn‚Äôt even reach that standard.The three types of uni from different regions included one that had turned gelatinous; I wondered if it would hardly sell even at half price as clearance at a fish market. Other users' photos show variations of uni that have similar gelatinous appearances, so I wonder if this is the quality they serve (they mentioned Bafun uni and Murasaki uni). I recall sushi restaurants in Manila, Philippines, serving uni like that. The other two units were not as melted but lacked the granular quality, and comparing their flavors didn‚Äôt provide much to discuss.Additionally, it was surprising to find some menu items sold out at 6 PM. They had few options from the start and charge somewhat high prices. On this day, one of the missing items was... anago (sea eel)???For a conveyor belt sushi place, having a staple like anago unavailable at such an early hour seems like quite a flaw.Overall, I would honestly compare the experience to paying double for cheap but taste-focused conveyor belt sushi chains like ""Nemuro Hanamaru"" or ""Choshi Maru."" Conversely, if I think of this as getting to eat ""Ginza Onodera"" sushi at a quarter of the price, then perhaps I can consider myself fortunate.","Here are the words representing the reviewer's impressions:

The way they cooked the anago (broiled eel) was great as well. The nori (seaweed) was tasty too. The craftsmanship of the chefs was superb. However, the rice today felt a bit dry. I wondered if the water ratio was off. To put it plainly, it was a bit hard. The rice stuck to my teeth and was difficult to remove.

372,Roughly Made Sushi,"I was thinking of going to the standing sushi bar, but I heard it will reopen in June. So I visited this non-conveyor sushi place instead. I didn't plan to report on it, so I didn't take any photos.On Thursday, May 26th, around 5:30 PM. There were some empty seats, and I was shown to a table right away.I ordered some sushi featuring my companion's favorite types of fish, starting with mackerel and small horse mackerel. Both were excellent and paired well with the sushi rice, so the meal started off well. However, the mackerel sushi was quite poorly shaped. While the mackerel itself was delicious, it didn't hold together as sushi.It seems there‚Äôs quite a disparity in the skills of the sushi makers here. The sea bream that followed was also lacking a sense of unity, not quite what I'd call sushi.From our seat, we could see the sushi maker closest to the entrance, who was quite fastmaybe a bit too hastybut their technique was rather nice. It seems that not all the artisans here possess the same level of skill.I ordered marinated tuna out of curiosity for comparison with other restaurants. The tuna was indeed delicious, but I‚Äôd say the quality as sushi was only around a 3 out of 10. The red clam was pretty good. As for the sea eel, while the fish was tasty, the glaze application was sloppy, and it didn‚Äôt have any level of completion as sushi. The castella egg was expected to have a fluffy texture, but it didn‚Äôt have much flavor.For my closing dish, I had kanpyo maki. This was the most impressive part of the meal today. The strong acidity of the sushi rice combined with the sweetness of the kanpyo and the crisp seaweed created a wonderful harmony. I would have preferred a bit more rice, packed more firmly, but that‚Äôs just a matter of personal preference.I don't think I will revisit this place, but I definitely want to try the standing bar.
